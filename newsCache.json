        "excerpt": "Letting nature do its trick can lock up loads of carbon, a new study shows.",
        "summary": "Michael Dantas/AFP/Getty Images/Grist\nThis story was originally published by\nGrist\nand is reproduced here as part of the\nClimate Desk\ncollaboration\n.\nJohnny Appleseed's heart\nwas in the right place when he walked all over the early United States planting fruit trees. Ecologically, though, he had room for improvement: To create truly dynamic ecosystems that host a lot of biodiversity, benefit local people, and produce lots of different foods, a forest needs a wide variety of species. Left on their own, some deforested areas can rebound surprisingly fast with minimal help from humans, sequestering loads of atmospheric carbon as they grow.\nNew research from an international team of scientists,\nrecently published in the journal\nNature\n, finds that 830,000 square miles of deforested land in humid tropical regions—an area larger than Mexico—could regrow naturally if left on its own. Five countries—Brazil, China, Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico—account for 52 percent of the estimated potential regrowth. According to the researchers, that would boost biodiversity, improve water quality and availability, and suck up 23.4 gigatons of carbon over the next three decades.\n'A rainforest can spring up in one to three years—it can be brushy and hard to walk through,' said Matthew Fagan, a conservation scientist and geographer at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and a coauthor of the paper. 'In five years, you can have a completely closed canopy that's 20 feet high. I have walked in rainforests 80 feet high that are 10 to 15 years old. It just blows your mind.'\nThat sort of regrowth isn't a given, though. First of all, humans would have to stop using the land for intensive agriculture—think big yields thanks to fertilizers and other chemicals—or raising hoards of cattle, the sheer weight of which compacts the soil and makes it hard for new plants to take root. Cows, of course, also tend to nosh on young plants.\n'Unless or until we can match that natural complexity, we're always going to be a step behind what nature is doing.'\nSecondly, it helps for tropical soil to have a high carbon content to nourish plants. 'Organic carbon, as any person who loves composting knows, really helps the soil to be nutritious and bulk itself up in terms of its ability to hold water,' Fagan said. 'We found that places with soils like that are much more likely to have forests pop up.'\nAnd it's also beneficial for a degraded area to be near a standing tropical forest. That way, birds can fly across the area, pooping out seeds they have eaten in the forest. And once those plants get established, other tree-dwelling animal species like monkeys can feast on their fruits and spread seeds, too. This initiates a self-reinforcing cycle of biodiversity, resulting in one of those 80-foot-tall forests that's only a decade old.\nThe more biodiversity, the more a forest can withstand shocks. If one species disappears because of disease, for instance, another similar one might fill the void. That's why planting a bunch of the same species of tree—à la Johnny Appleseed— pales in comparison to a diverse rainforest that comes back naturally.\n'When you have that biodiversity in the system, it tends to be more functional in an ecological sense, and it tends to be more robust,' said Peter Roopnarine, a paleoecologist at the California Academy of Sciences, who studies the impact of the climate on ecosystems but wasn't involved in the new paper. 'Unless or until we can match that natural complexity, we're always going to be a step behind what nature is doing.'\nGovernments and nonprofits can now use the data gathered from this research to identify places to prioritize for cost-effective restoration, according to Brooke Williams, a research fellow at the University of Queensland and the paper's lead author. 'Importantly, our dataset doesn't inform on where should and should not be restored,' she said, because that's a question best left to local governments.\nOne community, for instance, might rely on a crop that requires open spaces to grow. But if the locals can thrive with a regrown tropical forest—by, say, earning money from tourism and growing crops like coffee and cocoa within the canopy, a practice known as agroforestry—their government might pay them to leave the area alone.\nSusan Cook-Patton, senior forest restoration scientist at the Nature Conservancy, said that more than 1,500 species have been used in agroforestry worldwide. 'There's a lot of fruit trees, for example, that people use, and trees that provide medicinal services,' Cook-Patton said. 'Are there ways that we can help shift the agricultural production towards more trees and boost the carbon value, the biodiversity value, and livelihoods of the people living there?'\nThe tricky bit here is that the world is warming and\ndroughts are worsening\n, so a naturally regrowing forest may soon find itself in different circumstances. 'We know the climate conditions are going to change, but there's still uncertainty with some of that change, uncertainty in our climate projection models,' Roopnarine said.\nSo while a forest is very much stationary, reforestation is, in a sense, a moving target for environmental groups and governments. A global goal known as\nthe Bonn Challenge\naims to restore 1.3 million square miles of degraded and deforested land by 2030. So far, more than 70 governments and organizations from 60 countries, including the United States, have signed on to contribute 810,000 square miles toward that target.\nSequestering 23.4 gigatons of carbon over three decades may not sound like much in the context of humanity's\n37 gigatons of emissions every year\n. But these are just the forests in tropical regions. Protecting temperate forests and sea grasses would capture still more carbon, in addition to newfangled techniques like\ngrowing cyanobacteria\n. 'This is one tool in a toolbox—it is not a silver bullet,' Fagan said. 'It's one of 40 bullets needed to fight climate change. But we need to use all available options.'",

Oleh Kiper said high-rise residential buildings, private houses and warehouses were damaged by the 'fall' of a drone. He did not specify whether the drone had been shot down by air defenses.\nA further 32 Russian drones were shot down over 10 Ukrainian regions, while 18 were 'lost,' according to Ukraine's Air Force, likely having been electronically jammed.\nA Russian aerial bomb struck a busy highway overnight in the northeastern Kharkiv province, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekohov said. No casualties were reported.\nRussia is mounting an intensified aerial campaign that Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to counter. However, doubts are deepening over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBorrell, however, reassured Ukraine of European support as he arrived in Kyiv on Saturday.\n'EU support to Ukraine has been my personal priority during my mandate and will remain on top of the EU's agenda,' he wrote on X.\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry said 50 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over seven Russian regions — more than half over the Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine.",

        "excerpt": "Comic Brent Terhune has satirized Donald Trump's base with a character he calls Alpha Male. What happens to Alpha Male now that Trump has won the election?",
        "summary": "Alpha Male has won.\nWhat happens now?\nComedian Brent Terhune has for years satirized the angry, working-class white man who rails against libtards and expresses unyielding devotion to Donald Trump. His monologues resound with right-wing rants and epitomize toxic masculinity in a character he calls Alpha Male. But the aggrieved American man now rides on a sense of vindication in celebrating Trump's return to the White House. And Terhune wonders what that means for his character and the nation.\n'I think he'll go from being a sore loser to a sore winner,' said Terhune, who lives outside Indianapolis in a blue-collar neighborhood. 'Alpha Male will always exist. He was there before Trump. He doesn't go away. He's your dad, your cousin. We all feel misunderstood and betrayed at times. But he's got to find a way to justify everything Trump and MAGA do. It's a weird hurdle, and a way for me to get out my frustrations.'\nTerhune — a former Boy Scout and a Catholic-school-raised liberal — abhors Trump and is nothing like his alter ego. Alpha Male, who wears a russet beard, wraparound sunglasses and a backward ball cap, is enamored with the likes of Tucker Carlson and has no tolerance for gender studies, critical race theory or what he sees as the liberal radicalization of a country that has succumbed to snowflakes and bibliophiles.\nThe character is at once emblematic and a caricature of the Joe Rogan demographic, bros and aging bros, mostly white but with a growing number of Latinos, who revere Elon Musk and march to Trump's crass, weaving rhetoric.\n'His people will be encouraged,' Terhune said of the president-elect, suggesting that the most extreme of Trump's followers will become more of a threat to democracy, civil rights and gender equality than during his first term.\n'He's an embodiment of who they are,' he said. 'They believe he hates the same things they do. They're willing to excuse anything and everything for their guy. There'll be no repercussions.'\nTrump and his allies ran a high-testosterone, anti-immigrant, protect-the-economy campaign that appealed to ranchers, mechanics, pastors, billionaires, college students and the radical Proud Boys. Musk — who has 204 million followers on X — urged men to turn out and vote, posting a militant reference on the day of the election: 'The cavalry has arrived. Men are voting in record numbers. They now realize everything is at stake.'\nMusk reposted an artist's depiction in which he, muscle-bound and stripped to the waist, resembles the Hulk carrying an American flag. Rogan sits atop Musk's shoulders lifting Trump toward the sky in a trinity that evokes both a savior complex and hyper-masculinity.\nSuch imagery suits Alpha Male. Terhune's character does not apologize. He does not equivocate. He represents, said Terhune, who was profiled in The Times last year, men who feel empowered by Trump's showman brashness and the belief that he shares their rage and bewilderment at a left-wing, woke society that conspires to leave them behind.\nAlpha Male was born out of what Terhune saw as the hypocrisy of conservatives who espouse American ideals, such as freedom of speech and religion, but attack anyone opposed their prescribed views. The character's first appearance came when Terhune posted 'Redneck Burns Nikes' in reaction to then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick taking a knee in 2016 during the national anthem to protest racism. That was followed by Alpha Male diatribes on book banning, the Black 'Little Mermaid,' Trump's mug shot, ruminations on Hunter Biden's laptop and swipes at President Biden, whom he calls 'Papa Long Hugs.'\nAlpha Male, whose videos have had millions of views on social media, has become a way for Terhune to understand and navigate the nation's divisions. The character is a funny, if unsettling, mirror who at times — like Archie Bunker before him — earns a degree of empathy. Terhune's irony and satire can be so sly that some people don't get the joke, thinking that Alpha Male is not an act but the comic's true self.\n'Is this satire or is this guy really as deranged as he sounds?' one man posted on Facebook.\nLike many liberals, Terhune, who spoke by phone from his home on the day after the election, was finding it difficult to reconcile the many ruptures and recriminations that have jolted the country since Trump's first campaign eight years ago.\nTrump's recent victory is 'a shocking but not so shocking revelation of where we are as a country,' said Terhune, the son of a lunch lady and a father who trucked fuel to construction sites. 'A lot of people were fed up with the last four years, but this says that people don't think past themselves. It is their need to put party over country for perceived patriotism. I'm a straight white guy. I'll probably be fine. But what about people who aren't straight and white?'\nThrough it all, though, the focus of Terhune's Alpha Male bits will stay on Trump and what he has shaped. In a recent video about Trump working at McDonald's, Alpha Male says, 'Mr. Trump doesn't need to work there. He was just sticking it to lying Kamala Harris. ... There's no proof she even worked there. Hell, are we even sure she was the attorney general of Commie-fornia? No. Are we even sure she was vice president? No. Nobody knows. There's no proof.'\nIn another skit, Alpha Male is the driver in the garbage truck Trump rode in after Biden's verbal gaffe suggesting that Trump's supporters were garbage: 'You done pissed me off, Joe, and if being a patriot is what they're calling garbage these days, then, yeah, I am garbage cause I'm going to show up to the polls wearing a garbage bag to show you what us white trash can do.'\nAlpha Male, sometimes tearing up when he recounts his many grievances, mythologizes Trump, a leader who survived an assassin's bullet, an army of prosecutors, 34 felony counts and endless scandal.\nAfter what authorities said would have been a second assassination attempt against Trump at his golf course in Florida, Terhune reimagines the incident in a video in which Trump grabs a golf club to deflect bullets: 'The first one he sent flying went back to the shooter, knocked his Bud Light clean out of his hand and he took off scared. And he was running away and there was an envelope of cash that fell out of his pocket. You could see on it, it said, 'Pay off from the Dumb-ocrats.' It was then that the Secret Service finally got off their lazy asses and did something.'\nThat is the kind of fervor — James Brown's 'It's a Man's Man's Man's World' played at the Republican National Convention in July — that has surrounded Trump since he swaggered onto the nation's political stage.\n'He can do no wrong,' said Terhune, mimicking his alter ego. 'If you don't like it, deal with it.'\nFor Tehrune, the only way to deal with it is to keep channeling Alpha Male's deep well of suspicion and anger.",

Photo by Justin Tang / The Canadian Press\nOTTAWA — Another company is now alleging it was defrauded by Liberal minister Randy Boissonnault's former business partner, Stephen Anderson, who it says leveraged the employment minister's name to legitimize a 'fraudulent scheme.'\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nIn an affidavit dated Nov. 5, Michael R. Weber, the lawyer for California-based medical supply distribution company 4M Medical, said the company Boissonnault co-owned with Anderson took US$250,000 in a deposit for medical gloves that were never delivered.\nBoissonnault and Anderson had co-founded Global Health Imports (GHI) in the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic as a PPE distributor. When Boissonnault was elected in the fall 2021 and appointed to cabinet, he was required to cease involvement in GHI's operations, although he continued to co-own it.\nThe 4M affidavit was filed in support of a lawsuit by another company, the Ghaoui Group, which alleges Anderson and two other GHI employees made off with a US$500,000 deposit in 2022 for personal equipment that was never delivered.\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nGlobal News has reported there have been at least a half-dozen lawsuits against GHI since it was founded in early 2020.\nWeber's affidavit alleges a similar modus operandi by Anderson and GHI against 4M Medical that resulted in a US$250,000 loss. None of the allegations by Ghaoui or 4M have been tested in court.\nIn a statement, Boissonnault's spokesperson Alice Hansen said the minister was neither involved nor aware of GHI's business dealings with 4M because he ceased to have 'any role with operations of GHI' after he was elected.\n'The allegation that Mr. Anderson was using the Minister's name, without his permission and after he had ceased being involved in the work of the company, is very disturbing. If Mr. Anderson was in fact doing so he should come tell the truth and come clean with the public,' Hansen said in response to questions from the National Post.\nOn social media, Boissonnault said that going into business with Anderson was 'an error of judgment.'\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nParliament is currently investigation questions over communications by Anderson referring to business dealings with someone named 'Randy' after Boissonnault was appointed to cabinet.\nWeber's affidavit describes that 4M agreed to buy 100,000 boxes of nitrile gloves from GHI on Aug. 18, 2022. The deal would later require that 4M pay a US$250,000 deposit to secure the shipment.\nIn the weeks following the agreement, Weber says Anderson grew 'increasingly frustrated' with perceived delays in obtaining 4M's deposit and used numerous pressure tactics to 'induce the sending of the funds.'\nThat included warning that his business partners, including 'Randy,' were getting impatient and threatening to cancel the deal and sell the gloves to another company, according to transcripts of messages included in the affidavit.\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n'Anderson would threaten the loss of the deal and the frustration of his business partners and team, namely … 'Randy' whom Anderson said was his business partner and member of the Canadian Parliament, who I later discovered was Randy Boissonnault,' the affidavit alleges.\nRecommended from Editorial\nIn an interview with National Post, Weber said he never met nor spoke to Boissonnault during his dealings with GHI. But he said Anderson made it clear that 'Randy' was 'involved in Parliament' and frequently mentioned Boissonnault's name to boost the company's credibility.\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n'The understanding was that the particular texts … suggested that there was approval power on our deal with somebody named Randy,' Weber said.\n'Obviously, claiming what he claimed about Randy being at the government brings the guard down,' he added. Anderson 'clearly leveraged off of it,' he said. However, Weber said he does not know how much Boissonnault was actually involved in GHI's dealings.\nIn his affidavit, Weber claimed the pressure tactics GHI and Anderson used on him and 4M were the same allegedly used with Ghaoui Group.\nOn Oct. 17, 2022, Weber says that 4M's US$250,000 deposit was sent to GHI. But he claims GHI never delivered the gloves, despite relentless questions and pressure from 4M.\nIn January 2023, the affidavit claims 4M and GHI agreed to terminate the deal and Anderson's company would return the deposit within 72 hours.\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nWeber says that never happened, dealing a significant blow to 4M and himself.\n'Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to recover any amount from GHI,' he swore in the affidavit. 'Further, the investor who supplied the $250,000 deposit has sued me for lost principal plus interest. Needless to say, Anderson's fraudulent behavior has cost me and my family significant time plus the cost to repay his theft and lost opportunities associated therewith.'\n'I firmly believe that Stephen Anderson … was running a fraudulent scheme, wherein he would induce prospective purchasers to provide a large deposit for a quantity of goods he had no means or intention of providing and that he would ultimately convert the Deposit to his personal ends.'\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nNeither Anderson nor his counsel responded to detailed questions from National Post by email.\nOn Thursday, Conservatives tabled a motion to have Boissonnault testify again before the committee to answer for the new allegations in the Weber affidavit.\nNational Post also revealed Thursday that GHI had twice bid for federal government medical-supply contracts in 2022 while declaring itself 'a wholly owned Indigenous and LGBTQ Company' and 'Aboriginal.'\nOn Friday, Boissonault issued a statement saying he had never authorized Anderson to make 'false representations' of GHI as Indigenous-owned, and clarified that does not have Aboriginal status.\nThe minister said he 'surrendered' his shares in GHI this summer.\nNational Post\ncnardi@postmedia.com\nGet more deep-dive National Post political coverage and analysis in your inbox with the Political Hack newsletter, where Ottawa bureau chief Stuart Thomson and political analyst Tasha Kheiriddin get at what's really going on behind the scenes on Parliament Hill every Wednesday and Friday, exclusively for subscribers.

        "excerpt": "With a Republican-controlled Senate, possibly the House as well, and a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, he now has the opportunity to shift public policy significantly to the right.",
        "summary": "WASHINGTON — With his victory, President-elect Donald Trump has reshaped American politics, putting together a conservative, working-class coalition, including a number of Black and Latino voters, that has the potential to hold a majority for years.\nWith a Republican-controlled Senate, probably the House as well, and a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, he now has the opportunity to shift public policy significantly to the right.\nOr he could impulsively drive the whole thing into the ditch.\nIn his victory speech early Wednesday, Trump claimed voters had given him a 'powerful mandate.'\nThey did, but for limited purposes.\nThe campaign showed, and exit polls confirmed, that a broad swath of voters mostly want Trump to do two things — ensure against another bout of inflation and reduce the number of immigrants entering the U.S.\nThere's much less reason to think voters long to hand broad government authority over to Elon Musk or give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. control of federal health policy.\nOn other topics, there's strong evidence of what might be called an anti-mandate. Even in conservative states, for example, voters made clear that they oppose moves to restrict abortion. There's very little support in the country for rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, despite the wishes of some of Trump's evangelical supporters.\nAnd there's little public support for Trump to go on a revenge spree against his Democratic opponents.\nPreventing a new round of widespread price increases should be easy: Inflation is already largely under control after the rapid rise in costs of 2022 and early 2023, and interest rates are coming down. Doing nothing would basically get the job done.\nThe problem is that Trump doesn't want to do nothing. He wants to do several things — including imposing massive tariffs and enacting new individual and corporate tax cuts — that run a high inflationary risk.\nCongress has given presidents a lot of power to levy tariffs — taxes on imports. But doing so would raise the cost of goods across the economy, a wide range of economists have warned.\nBig tax cuts would increase the federal deficit, which is already running at record levels. That, too, is inflationary.\nImmediately after the election, interest rates rose as bond investors began to price in the possibility of renewed inflation under Trump.\nThe new administration could seek to offset tax cuts with spending reductions, especially on healthcare and aid to the poor and elderly. Many Democrats believe he will back a renewed Republican effort to make deep cuts in Medicaid and cut health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which make coverage possible for tens of millions of Americans.\nBut this time around, Trump avoided committing himself to repealing the healthcare law, a crusade that ended in political disaster for him last time.\nMoreover, the history of the past half-century repeatedly has shown that Republicans talk about spending cuts when out of power much more than they enact them when in power. Instead, they default to more debt, which was the pattern of Trump's first term.\nReducing the immigrant population could be even trickier for the new administration.\nVoters unquestionably soured on immigration during President Biden's tenure. A majority now wants fewer immigrants entering the country, legally or illegally, and is open to the idea of mass deportations of people who live in the U.S. without legal authorization.\nTrump's core supporters feel especially strongly about the issue. About one-third of them listed immigration as their most important issue, according to the AP VoteCast survey of 115,000 voters.\nTheir anger doesn't stop at the border. Immigrants currently make up about 14% of the U.S. population — near a record high. That's helped the economy, staving off the sort of labor shortages and population declines that have hurt countries like Japan and South Korea. But it has also brought social and cultural changes that have unsettled many Americans.\nBut majority sentiment can swing both ways. When Trump moved against immigrants in his first term, many Americans believed he went too far. That generated a wave of pro-immigrant sympathy.\nTrump has vowed to adopt 'the biggest domestic deportation campaign in American history.' His advisor, Stephen Miller, has talked about assembling a 'giant force' of National Guard troops and law enforcement officers from conservative states to hunt down millions of residents living in the country illegally, truck them to detention camps and then expel them.\nIn August, a majority of voters — 56% overall and 88% of Trump supporters — said they strongly or somewhat favored 'mass deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally,' according to a Pew Research Center survey.\nThat doesn't mean, however, that they'd support Miller's dreams.\nVoters' views on immigration are often complicated. A separate question on the same Pew survey found that 61% of voters — although only one-third of Trump supporters — said that immigrants who lack legal status should be able to 'stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met.'\nOther surveys have found that support for deportation drops when pollsters ask about specific categories of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, such as longtime residents, spouses of U.S. citizens and people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nThe efforts to prosecute Trump for federal crimes are over. Any president has the authority to tell the Justice Department to drop a case, and Trump has said he will do so and fire special counsel Jack Smith 'within two seconds.'\nSmith is already making plans to wind down his efforts and asked a judge to put all proceedings in the election interference case on hold.\nTrump can't similarly eliminate the two criminal cases against him in state court — the New York hush money and fraud case on which he was convicted in May and the Georgia case on which he was indicted on charges of interfering with the 2020 election. Presidents don't have authority over local district attorneys or state judges.\nThose cases, however, aren't as much of a threat to Trump as the federal prosecutions were.\nTrump hasn't yet been sentenced in the New York case — sentencing is currently set for Nov. 26 — but the judge could dismiss the case before a Tuesday deadline or postpone sentencing indefinitely, and any sanction beyond a fine is deemed to be unlikely.\nThe Georgia case has faced one problem after another and may be fatally mired.\nBeyond shutting down the cases against him, Trump for nearly two years has suggested he would pardon some or all of the people convicted of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, many of whom were convicted of attacking law enforcement officers.\nBoth of those steps would provoke outrage from liberals — something Trump appears to enjoy — but Tuesday's results strongly suggest a majority of voters won't care much.\nThey might feel otherwise, however, if Trump follows through on his threats to use federal power to go after his political opponents. He's talked of appointing a special counsel to pursue unspecified investigations into Biden, for example, and sometimes has revived eight-year-old threats to prosecute former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent.\nOne thing a large majority of Americans consistently agree on is a desire for less partisan confrontation.\nTrump will come under a lot of pressure from the antiabortion wing of the Republican Party to impose new restrictions. There's a lot he could do without any new legislation from Congress, especially to limit medication abortions.\nThroughout the campaign, he avoided answering questions about what, if any, restrictions he'd approve. His public statements have made clear that he understands the political danger the issue poses to his party.\nIn the current election, voters approved abortion rights measures in two very conservative states, Montana and Missouri, as well as in the swing states of Arizona and Nevada, and three liberal states — Colorado, Maryland and New York. In Trump's home state, Florida, an abortion rights measure won a clear majority, 57%, although it failed to hit the 60% needed to amend the state constitution.\nJust under two-thirds of voters nationwide said abortion should be legal in all (25%) or most (38%) cases, according to the APVoteCast survey. The exit poll conducted for the major television networks had a very similar number.\nOne key to Trump's victory is that he won 40% of the voters who said the procedure should be legal in most cases, the AP survey found. The network exit poll pegged the share even higher — 49%.\nAll that suggests Democrats failed to convince a big swath of voters that Trump significantly threatened abortion rights.\nThat's consistent with how voters viewed Trump overall: More than half said they believed his views were 'too extreme.' But enough of those voters sided with him anyway to carry him to victory.\nWhether he assuages their doubts or deepens them will quickly determine whether he can convert this week's win into a lasting political triumph or a series of self-inflicted wounds.\nLA Times special: With progressive ballot measures on track to fail, California's political identity is questioned\nExit polls: Two exit polls give preliminary data on this year's voters. Here's the poll conducted for the major television networks and the APVoteCast survey.\n—Was this newsletter forwarded to you? Sign up here to get it in your inbox.",

        "excerpt": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he would \"absolutely\" consider pardoning every Capitol rioter and has called them political prisoners and \"hostages.\"",
        "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to focus on arresting the \"most egregious\" Jan. 6 rioters — particularly those who committed felony assaults on law enforcement officers but have not yet been arrested — in the remaining 72 days before President-elect Donald Trump is back in the White House, a law enforcement official told NBC News this week.\nTrump is expected to shut down the years-long investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and has said he would 'absolutely' pardon some, if not all, of his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol that day, labeling them ' warriors,' ' unbelievable patriots,' political prisoners and ' hostages.' A Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on which rioters Trump would consider pardoning, though the campaign previously said that he would pardon Jan. 6 defendants on a \"case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House.\"\nGiven Trump's stunning election victory, federal prosecutors in the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section received guidance this week about how to proceed in pending Jan. 6 cases, NBC News has learned, including a directive to oppose any Jan. 6 defendant's requests for delays. Prosecutors are instructed to argue that there is a societal interest in the quick administration of justice and these cases should be handled in the normal order.\nAs for new arrests, the law enforcement official said, prosecutors will \"focus on the most egregious conduct and cases until the end of the administration.\" There are unlikely to be any further arrests of misdemeanor Jan. 6 defendants — such as those who entered the Capitol but did not assault law enforcement — unless a judge already signed off on those cases, but felony assault cases will proceed, the official said.\nOnline sleuths who have aided the FBI in hundreds of arrests of Capitol rioters told NBC News they have identified and submitted evidence to the bureau on 75 peope who are currently featured on the FBI's Capitol Violence webpage and labeled as wanted for assault on a federal officer or for assault on media, both felonies.\nFederal officials would have to pick up the pace to get just those cases over the finish line before Trump walks through the lower west tunnel — where his supporters fought law enforcement in a battle multiple officers described as \"medieval\" — to take the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\"Just over 1 per day,\" one of the online \" sedition hunters\" who has dedicated hours of their life to finding the Trump supporters who brutally assaulted law enforcement officers that day, told NBC News. \"Place your bets!\"\n\"We didn't spend the last four years tracking these criminals down just to have dozens of them avoid prosecution because half of the country are f---ing morons,\" another of the online sleuths said. \"Our work continues, as should the DOJ's.\"\nExisting cases against Jan. 6 defendants are expected to continue with additional trials, sentencing hearings and plea agreement hearings scheduled to take place next week.\nThe FBI has arrested over 1,560 Jan. 6 defendants so far. Prosecutors have secured more than 1,100 convictions and more than 600 defendants have received sentences of incarceration ranging from days in jail to 22 years in federal prison.\nThis week, a rioter who assaulted law enforcement officers and smashed in the windows to the House Speaker's Lobby just before a fellow rioter was shot — and then became the target of a conspiracy theory suggesting he was a federal informant — was sentenced to eight years in federal prison.\nA former assistant U.S. attorney in the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section told NBC News this week that prosecutors are proud of the work they've done, but understandably nervous about the future and demoralized. Many prosecutors got involved in these cases because of their desire to uphold the rule of law and to defend democracy, the former assistant U.S. attorney said, but the cases became about vindicating the victims, who are primarily police officers.\n\"You spend any amount of time understanding what hell the police officers went through and watching the body-worn cameras where you stand in their shoes and you see people physically assaulting them and taking cheap shots at them and hitting them from behind, and using racial slurs against them, for hours and hours as they stood there and tried to protect the Capitol and people inside it, and the cases become about the victims,\" he said. \"So the idea that people who committed those crimes against those victims, people who assaulted those officers, would be pardoned, we just really hope people are thinking twice before doing that.\"\nThe prospect of presidential pardons for people who assaulted law enforcement is \"pretty demoralizing,\" the former assistant U.S. attorney said.\n\"The idea that the most powerful person in the country says it's okay, it's okay to the person who sprayed them with bear spray, or hit them with a hockey stick, or drag them down steps, or, in the case of Michael Fanone, tased them in the neck and caused them to have a heart attack, or, in the case of Daniel Hodges, trap them in between doors and continue to squeeze them in between doors while they while Hodges was screaming for his life, that part of it is, it's so wretched,\" he said.\nProsecutors are extraordinarily proud of the work they've done and take solace in the notion that inside courtrooms — where facts, not political rhetoric, control the outcome of jury trials — American citizens who faced down the real evidence did the right thing, the former prosecutor said.\n\"The evidence is overwhelming, and the testimony of the officers was overwhelming,\" he said. \"Time and time and time again, when people are confronted with the evidence, it points in the same direction.\"\nFormer Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, an immigrant from the Dominican Republican and military veteran who wrote a book about his experience coming to America, learning English, serving in the military and then being repeatedly assaulted by his fellow Americans at the Capitol on Jan. 6, continues to attend sentencing hearings for the criminals who assaulted him. His injuries from the attack forced him to retire in 2022; he's in his mid-40s.\nGonell, who campaigned on behalf of Kamala Harris, said he won't let the story of Jan. 6 fade away, even after Trump takes office.\n\"Whether he pardons them or not, that doesn't take away what they did and what I went through,\" Gonell said. \"They — they cannot erase that history.\"\n\"If you remove Trump's name out of the equation, and if you remove who they were supporting, would people who voted for him, would they be okay with what happened? Would they be supportive of me?\" Gonell asked. \"And that's the question, it creates a moral injury.\"\n'It's not a good feeling,\" he continued, \"when you feel like nobody cares about what happened that day.'",

        "excerpt": "\"It's not enough just for people to hit the streets, we need to build political power,\" according to Women's March director Rachel O'Leary Carmona.",
        "summary": "A resistance movement was born in the wake of Donald Trump's 2016 victory, sending thousands of people into the streets wearing pink hats and signs with punchy slogans.\nThe leaders of left-leaning groups that emerged in response to Trump's first election say they expect to be just as forceful in pushing back against the policy moves of a second Trump administration.\n'I think that folks are very angry and are going to be turning out,' Rachel O'Leary Carmona, the executive director of Women's March, told NBC News. But '2016 was a long time ago, a pandemic ago, two presidential terms ago. Things are going to be different. It's not going to be the same.'\nFollowing Trump's re-election on Tuesday, scattered protests broke out in Seattle, Chicago, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, but they haven't drawn the attention — or the numbers — that similar protests garnered in 2016 and early 2017.\nWomen's March is already organizing snap rallies and protests for this weekend in New York and Washington, plus a massive 'People's March on Washington' the weekend before Trump's inauguration.\nBut in the years since Women's March and other resistance groups formed to combat the rhetoric and policies of the Trump era, the movement has evolved beyond just rallies and marches, O'Leary Carmona said.\n'I think this is a different movement — an older and more mature movement,' she said. '2016 was a volunteer-led groundswell. ... Now it's a movement beyond the moment — it's not about visibility, but building power.'\nFor example, Women's March, a group born out of many women's immediate reaction to Trump's first election, has evolved into a group that seeks to ' build a multi-racial feminist future ' by working to combat disinformation online, fighting to cancel student debt, promoting progressive paid parental leave policies and more.\n'We have a heavy focus on absorption,' O'Leary Carmona said. 'It's not enough just for people to hit the streets, we need to build political power.'\nThis time around, compared to 2016, 'we have connections to people that are building policy,' she added.\nMaurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that works to mobilize voters and organizers, echoed O'Leary Carmona in a post on X Thursday.\n'If we're serious about winning, we need to take some hard lessons and admit where we were wrong,' he wrote. 'It's also not enough to dust off the 2016 'resistance' playbook. It's time for a new playbook.'\nIn an interview with NBC News, Mitchell said that 'far-right' political movements are 'banking on their form of chaos to destabilize us so that we move from putting out one fire to another.'\nHe added, 'In some ways, some of that happened in 2016. There was one manufactured crisis after another, and we were trying to mitigate harm, and very much being on the defensive, and in some ways, being flat-footed.'\nIn 2024, Mitchell said, 'We actually planned for this scenario.'\n'We're not flat-footed,' he added. 'We believe our mandate is to go on the offensive. Even though we're experiencing an electoral defeat, we're reminded that tens of millions of people voted in a rebuke of this man, MAGA, of the Project 2025 rulebook. And it's those people that we need to organize in the wake of this election.'\nStill, in the days following this election, the anti-Trump movement seemed notably quieter online than it did in 2016, with some describing the resistance as ' tired ' or ' dormant.'\nOn a Thursday-evening video call led by left-leaning groups MoveOn, Indivisible, the Working Families Party and others, leaders told their communities that it was OK to take a beat before fighting onward.\n'The one feeling we cannot allow ourselves to sit in is hopelessness,' MoveOn Executive Director Rahna Epting told the 130,000 viewers gathered on the call.\n'I know for some folks on the call, maybe that's a tall order right now, to ask you to keep hope alive,' she added. 'But hope is the fuel we need, hope that there's still more people that believe in love and peace over hate and divisiveness.'\nEpting told NBC News that she's hopeful about the future of the movement, pointing to the thousands of people who joined the call and other metrics, like the fact that over 8,000 attendees on Thursday expressed interest in hosting their own community gatherings in the following weeks.\n'Trump would like for us to believe that our power has evaporated in a single night. We won't allow that mindset to sink in, so we'll equip our base with resources to process what happened and funnel them into action instead of hopelessness,' Epting said in a statement to NBC News.\nMitchell also pointed to the fact that the 2017 Women's March, where millions across the nation protested ahead of Trump's inauguration, was held months after the election, not days. 'It just seems very premature' to suggest the energy isn't there, he said.\n'It's not the end of the movement. We can't fold like picnic chairs because we fielded a loss,' O'Leary Carmona said.\nShe offered a metaphor: 'If you personally are tired, it's like a choir long note: One person drops out and the rest carry the tune. Rest, but don't stay at rest. There's a movement that's here, that's moving.'",

A new member orientation will also take place that evening.\nOn Wednesday at 9:30 a.m., GOP senators who will still be in office next Congress and senators-elect will meet to cast anonymous ballots for the coveted leadership spots. A simple majority is required for each position. A second round of ballots may be required to determine the leader.\nSenate Democrats won't hold their elections until early December.\nMcConnell successor\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD), Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), and Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) are gunning for the top job. Trump's triumphant comeback is\nThune is perceived as the marginal front-runner, given his role as McConnell's deputy. But lawmakers and insiders still say it's a toss-up against Cornyn. Scott, who is pushing an anti-establishment agenda and backed by Trump-world allies off Capitol Hill including Glenn Beck, Charlie Kirk, and Dan Bongino, will capture a sizable chunk of the most conservative wing of the conference but is the underdog.\nThune is trying to\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), who's backing Thune, has privately urged Trump to refrain from entering the mix. Others who publicly support Thune include Sens. Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Steve Daines (R-MT), chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm and a close Trump ally.\n'There's only one person in the race that President Trump just absolutely does not get along with,' Mullin told the\nWashington Examiner\n, declining to elaborate if he was referring to Cornyn or Scott. 'But Thune and him are in a good place.'\nCornyn served as majority whip when Trump was president and has also had regular discussions with Trump. His bid is backed publicly by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO).\nBoth Thune and Cornyn and prolific fundraisers and campaigners for Republican senators and candidates, each raising tens of millions of dollars this cycle for GOP colleagues as they ran for leader.\nBut only one of them, Scott, doesn't have a rocky past with Trump. In fact, Trump endorsed Scott's first leadership run in a failed challenge against McConnell in 2022. Scott is backed publicly by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n'I'm feeling good about Thune,' a senior Senate GOP aide said. 'Would be surprised if it went any other way.'\nGOP Senate whip\nSen. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, is running unopposed for the No. 2 spot to replace Thune as whip.\nSenate Republican Conference chair\nThe only other contested race among leadership is for Barrasso's No. 3 spot being sought by No. 4 GOP Policy Committee Chairwoman Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR). The two spent the summer and fall crisscrossing the country to campaign and fundraise for Republican Senate hopefuls.\nThe match is competitive, but insiders say there is a real chance for Cotton to pull off an upset victory and oust Ernst from leadership.\nGOP Senate policy chair\nFifth-ranked Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) is also looking to move up a rung by ascending to Ernst's spot as GOP policy chair. Capito is running unopposed.\nNRSC chair\nDaines, fresh off winning Republicans back the majority, isn't vying for another cycle as head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC), the former presidential candidate who was on Trump's VP short list, is running unopposed to take the helm of the campaign arm. Scott's White House run elevated his national profile, which he's used to campaign and fundraise for Trump and GOP Senate candidates across the country.\nHouse Republicans move forward with own elections\nHouse Republicans will hold their leadership elections on Wednesday to elect, or reelect, rather, their slate of top GOP leaders in the lower chamber. Lawmakers have until Tuesday to submit their names for consideration before the conference holds a candidate forum Wednesday morning.\nThe election will then be open throughout the day. It's not clear when the results will be announced.\nMost of the leadership positions appear unchallenged heading into next week, with the top four GOP lawmakers running for another term in their leadership positions.\nHouse Democrats will hold their leadership elections the following week, beginning on Nov. 19 and ending on Nov. 20, according to a letter sent to lawmakers on Thursday.\nHouse speaker\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will run for another term as the top House lawmaker, assuming Republicans hold on to their slim majority, and that position will be decided in a congresswide vote at the beginning of next year.\nHowever, Johnson will need to use the next few weeks to firm up support among the House GOP to avoid a repeat of what happened in January 2023, when it took 15 ballots for then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy to secure the gavel.\nOne of Johnson's strongest advantages is the support of Trump, who has praised the speaker's leadership and has said he expects him 'to be around for a long time.'\nHowever, that could be easier said than done. At least two House Republicans, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), have vowed not to support a future speakership bid from Johnson — which could spell trouble if Republicans have a similarly slim majority come next January.\nNo other Republican has publicly announced a bid for speaker as of Friday. The speaker does not need to be an elected member of the House.\nHouse majority leader\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) will run for another term as House majority leader, which has fewer hurdles than the speakership position. To be reelected, Scalise only needs a simple majority of the GOP conference when they reconvene next week.\nScalise announced his intention to run for another term in a 'Dear Colleague' letter sent to House Republicans this week, in which he touted plans to support Trump for an aggressive agenda in his first 100 days.\n'We methodically laid out a road map — passing key aspects of Trump's bold agenda to clearly show how we would govern if given this historic opportunity,' Scalise wrote. 'Now, we need a Majority Leader who knows how to take that road map and, under President Trump's leadership, implement a bold, conservative Republican agenda. I am running to continue the work I started as Majority Leader, and I humbly ask for your support.'\nHouse majority whip\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) will also run for a third term in his No. 3 slot, which also requires only a simple majority vote in the GOP conference.\nHe is currently running unopposed. In his letter to lawmakers, Emmer vowed he will 'always be direct, honest, and transparent' and 'never make false promises or try to buy your votes.'\n'As Majority Whip, my role is to support every Member of this Conference to help you be successful,' he wrote.\nHouse Republican Conference chair\nOne question mark about GOP leadership is the position held by House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY).\nStefanik assumed the fourth-highest ranking position in May 2021, quickly establishing herself as a staunch and close ally of Trump. That loyalty put Stefanik on his initial short list for vice presidential contenders and in consideration for a position in his second administration.\nStefanik sent a letter to GOP lawmakers on Thursday announcing her intent to run for the position again, outlining her priorities for the next Congress. However, it's unclear whether she would vacate that post to serve in the Trump administration or who would replace her if she does so.\nHouse GOP policy chair\nOne of the only brewing leadership fights in the House GOP conference is for the position of policy chair.\nThe position is responsible for formulating and promoting Republican policy initiatives and is the fifth-highest position in the House Republican majority. The seat is held by Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), who announced he would run again for another term.\nHowever, Palmer faces a challenge from Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. Hern announced his bid on Thursday along with a list of current and incoming GOP lawmakers who endorsed his candidacy: Reps. Tom Cole (R-OK), David Joyce (R-OH), Ronny Jackson (R-TX), Greg Murphy (R-NC), Nick Langworthy (R-NY), Rich McCormick (R-FL), and Mike Flood (R-NE), as well as Reps.-elect Tony Wied and Riley Moore, who just won seats in Wisconsin and West Virginia, respectively.\n'I've always been about policy over politics. It's good policy work that brings about true change for the American people. A rising tide lifts all boats — when our Conference delivers strong policy, we all win,' Hern wrote in a letter to GOP lawmakers. 'These two years will demand our absolute best. We need strong leadership, effective policies, and powerful bridgebuilders to get our agenda across the finish line. That is why I am humbly asking for your support to chair the Republican Policy Committee.'",

        "excerpt": "India's khadi fabric is a handwoven textile celebrated for its unique texture and sustainability.",
        "summary": "The charm of khadi is in its artistry and in the irregularity of the yarn, which creates a unique tactile fabric. This handspun and handwoven fabric, using natural fibres, is comfortable to wear since the low-twisted yarn allows the fabric to breathe and absorb moisture, and it becomes softer with every wash. This 'fabric of freedom' continues to spin incomes for the rural poor while reminding the country of its legacy of sustainable living and self-reliance. This remarkable fabric from the past has the potential of becoming the fabric of the future.\nI have been fascinated by all things handcrafted, especially textiles. Since the last few years, I have been trying to identify the exceptional qualities, beyond heritage value, of handloom fabrics to differentiate these products from machine-made textiles, and to emphasise their uniqueness for these fabrics to continue being relevant in present times. These deliberations led me to Gandhiji's writings to understand how and why he chose khaddar, the coarse handspun and handwoven cotton worn by the common man, which he named 'khadi', as a symbol of India's Independence.\nDuring India's struggle for freedom from British rule, social and political activism reached new heights under the visionary leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. He saw the revival of the local village economy as the key to India's spiritual and economic regeneration and he envisioned homespun khadi as the catalyst for India's economic independence. Khadi became the fabric of the freedom struggle, and the charkha, the spinning wheel, the symbol of India's Independence Movement. Rahul Ramagundam in his book, Gandhi's Khadi , mentions that 'Gandhi's khadi movement, in many substantive ways, was the first social movement in modern India that brought poverty to the centre stage of Indian consciousness and made livelihood rights an issue of mass mobilisation'.\nSoon after Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa in May 1915, he established the Satyagraha Ashram with 25 residents at Kochrab, Ahmedabad, and in July 1917, the ashram was shifted to a new location on the banks of the river Sabarmati. It was collectively decided that all the members of the ashram should wear khadi. Their objective was to stop using the imported mill-made cloth, which benefited the British at the expense of the Indian artisans, and clothe themselves in fabrics created by their own hands.\nThe American Civil War (1861–1865) had caused a shortage of American cotton, and Britain started buying raw cotton from India. Indian cotton was exported to Britain, starving its own looms of raw material, and cheaper British machine-made yarn and manufactured cloth were sent back to India taking away the livelihood of millions of men and women who earned a living by spinning yarn manually. Before the Industrial Revolution, Indian fabrics had been in great demand in Britain and comprised almost 70 per cent of the East India Company's exports, but later, Britain had imposed restrictions on their import, and the multitude of people involved in the production of cotton textiles in India had been affected.\nEveryone at the ashram was willing to learn to spin and wear the khadi fabric produced from their own handspun yarn but they could not find either a spinning wheel or someone to teach them how to spin. Around this time, Gandhiji was invited to preside at the Broach Educational Conference where he met Gangaben Majmundar, a remarkable woman with an enterprising spirit. Gandhiji requested her to look for spinning wheels, and after a long search she found what she was looking for in Vijapur, in what was then Baroda State. Many in this region had spinning wheels stored in their lofts as there was no demand for handspun yarn since the market was flooded with the imported yarn from Britain. They expressed their willingness to resume spinning if they were assured of a steady supply of cotton slivers, and that the yarn they produced would be bought back.\nGandhiji mentioned the need for a regular supply of cotton slivers to Umar Sobani, a textile mill owner, who willingly sent the sliver ropes from his spinning mill to Gangaben, and soon, vast quantities of yarn began to pour in from Vijapur. Gandhiji could not take Umar Sobani's generosity for granted, and he also realised that it was morally wrong to use mill-made slivers. Once again, Gandhiji requested Gangaben to find a person who would be willing to teach a few youngsters to clean and card cotton by hand and make slivers. She went a step further and also found weavers to weave the yarn that was spun in Vijapur, and soon, Vijapur khadi gained a solid reputation.\nWhile these developments were taking place in Vijapur, the spinning wheel gained a strong footing at the ashram. Maganlal Gandhi, who was closely associated with the Satyagraha Movement, was able to make some improvements in the traditional spinning wheel. He developed a new model of the box charkha with a double-wheel drive, which helped control its speed, and was an improvement as far as comfort, productivity and portability were concerned. Gandhiji led by example and spun for an hour every day. All ashram inmates started wearing khadi and were encouraged to spin daily for a minimum of one hour. They realised that apart from creating the yarn for their clothing, spinning calmed their minds, helped to increase their focus and was a meditative experience.\nGandhiji wore Indian mill-made dhotis but was impatient to start wearing only handspun and handwoven cotton khadi, but the coarse khadi produced at the ashram and at Vijapur was only 30 inches (76 cm) in width. He asked Gangaben to find a weaver who could weave a khaddar dhoti in 45 inches (114 cm) width for him. She managed this within a month and, soon after, there was a full-fledged weaving centre at the ashram to weave sarees, dhotis and running yardage. This was the beginning of the Khadi Movement. Soon after, spinning and weaving were elevated to an ideology for promoting self-reliance and self-government. To identify with the poor, in 1921 Gandhiji changed from formal Gujarati clothing to a simple, short dhoti and a shawl from formal Gujarati attire.\nIn the past, the charkha had supplemented agricultural income. It was a friend of the poor, the solace of the widow who was shunned by society, and kept the villagers from idleness. Every village had a family of weavers who wove coarse cotton fabrics without any patterns for use by the local communities. The weavers were supported by the women in the family who, in their free time, spun the yarn and created the bobbins for weaving. They had all lost their livelihood to the machine-made fabrics from Britain that were flooding the markets. The new demand for khadi provided them with regular work and rescued them from abject poverty. Gandhiji did not just revive India's flagging handloom industry, he made the humble handspun khadi fabric the symbol of the Swadeshi Movement. He wrote: 'Swaraj (self-rule) without swadeshi (goods made in the country) is a lifeless corpse and if swadeshi is the soul of swaraj, khadi is the essence of swadeshi.' Through his initiative, khadi became not only a symbol of resistance but the face of an Indian identity, 'The message of the spinning wheel was much wider than its circumference.'\nGandhiji saw khadi as a tool for reviving the village economy but he never suggested that 'those, who are more lucratively employed should give up their employment and prefer spinning'. As he clarified to Charlie Chaplin in 1931, 'The return to spinning did not mean a rejection of all modern technology but of the exploitative and controlling economic and political system in which textile manufacture had become entangled. Machinery in the past has made us dependent on England, and the only way we can rid ourselves of the dependence is to boycott all goods made by machinery.' He continues 'This is why we have made it the patriotic duty of every Indian to spin his own cotton and weave his own cloth.'\nWhen Gandhiji encouraged people across India to boycott clothes made in Britain, spin their own yarn and wear khadi, he was encouraging them to rediscover their heritage as well as to support handloom production in rural centres. This understated masterstroke took the Freedom Movement beyond the rarefied circles of the social elite and out to the masses.\n[ Niyogi Books has given Fair Observer permission to publish this excerpt from Crafting a Future: Stories of Indian Textiles and Sustainable Practices , Archana Shah, Niyogi Books, 2021.]\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer's editorial policy.",

The Haryana election resulted in a shock loss for Congress, which was looking to galvanize on the Lok Sabha poll performance, while J&K also saw the grand old party eventually stepping away from the cabinet, with Omar Abdullah 's JKNC forming government.

        "summary": "Quincy Jones, who died on November 3 aged 91, was the last major musician whose working life spanned the arc of 20th-century American music. Jones was born in 1933, only six years after Louis Armstrong recorded \"Struttin' With Some Barbeque,\" one of the Hot Five sides that crystallized the centrality of the solo instrumentalist in jazz. A child of the age when music ran at 78 r.p.m. or crackled out of analogue tubes, Jones saw out the music's transition into pure digitality, in which all prior recordings can be broken into their elements and, with pitch-shifting and tempo-tweaking, be infinitely recombined, and its first contacts with artificial intelligence. Throughout, Jones remained a jazz musician.\nIt is a tragedy that most of us think of three Michael Jackson albums when we hear Jones's name: Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), and Bad (1987). Even I think of them, and I think that Bad is very bad indeed. They were part of the aural and visual furniture in the MTV age, so we have no choice. Thriller is said to be the best-selling album of all time. I can believe it. Most of it is synthetic trash. Quincy Jones abused his musical intelligence to create something artificial, a slick Frankenstein's monster that flatters the listener. As Keith Richards said when someone asked him what he thought of rap: \"There's an enormous market for people who can't tell one note from another.\"\nOn \"Billie Jean,\" Jones cunningly recycled the modal groove of an earlier age. The song's vamp is pretty much that of Miles Davis's \"Milestones\" (1958) or, more precisely, Donald Byrd's \"Jeannine\" (1960). Jones, in his first musical incarnation, was a handy trumpeter. In his second, he was a killer arranger. By his own admission, he decided that he wanted to make some real money. He got \"points\" on the royalties for Jackson's albums. He had suffered for his art, and now it was our turn.\nIt was Jones's idea to add Eddie Van Halen's guitar histrionics to \"Beat It.\" Perhaps Jones realized that Jackson, who had given a passable impersonation of a normal person on their 1979 collaboration, was in fact not so much mildly off the wall but completely off the reservation, and becoming blatantly ludicrous. You can see Jackson's deterioration in the video for \"Beat It.\" Nobody has ever beaten anything after being told to beat it by a sylph sporting wet-look curls and a red leather jacket. The video, West Side Story with mullets, is even more ludicrous than the song.\nThe original meaning of \"ludicrous\" was \"sportive\" or \"intended as a jest.\" Jones was playing the pop game, and he played it better than anyone. Jones had arranged Count Basie's charts for the Sinatra at the Sands album in 1966. You have to know what good taste is before you can engineer a full-spectrum failure of taste such as \"Beat It.\" Like most child stars, Michael Jackson's talent was that of a performing seal. Jackson became a fake adult, a boy who never grew up: Pedo Pan. Jones made the best of a bad job.\nThe Bad album is even worse. The video for the title song is much like that of \"Beat It,\" only more obviously homoerotic and masochistic. Jackson, trussed up in PVC and studs, makes little jerky martial arts movements as though the director has attached electrodes to his royalties. Once again, Jones recycles a groove from his earlier career and not from one of his own compositions either. The \"Bad\" groove is lifted from Lalo Schifrin's \"Mission Impossible\" theme from 1967. The \"Billie Jean\" vamp could be a homage to two trumpeters who were better than Jones was. The squelchy synth-bass on \"Bad\" sounds like a revenge on a more talented rival.\nAgain, Jones devised a flattering setting for Jackson's deficiencies. Bluebeard's interior decorator probably did much the same at the castle. Jackson's once-smooth vocal style was shattering into the affected yelps and squeaks of a crossdresser whose bottom has been pinched. His compulsion to boast of his kinks while hiding them in plain sight was becoming explicit. Only a similarly fractured, distracting, and false assemblage of jerky drums and flashy synths could make it make sense. As the saying goes, you can't polish a turd. But you can roll it in glitter.\nOff the Wall, however, slips easily into the ear. The warmth of its sound marks the album as one of the last glories of the analogue recording age. That age began in 1860, when Scott de Martinville recorded \"Au Clair de la Lune,\" so the transition to digital really is a late aberration. The arrangements on Off the Wall have an echo of Swing Era romance, too. If Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had hobbled into a disco in 1979, they would dimly have recognized the orchestral swoons of \"Rock with You.\"\nQuincy Jones never made a bad record before he started working with Michael Jackson. He never made a good record after working with Jackson. This isn't because Jones lost his talent. He was a commercial artist, but the tinny new technology wasn't yet up to the task, and the harmony-less rise of the rappers, which Jones had the commercial nous to embrace, was shrinking the opportunities for adding a bit of jazzy class. The obituaries have all praised the Jackson albums, as though their quantity of sales is a mark of artistic quality. But Quincy Jones is like Joseph Conrad—it took 20 years of slogging before Conrad made a decent amount of money from his novels with Under Western Eyes (1911), but it wasn't one of his best. To really appreciate Quincy Jones, listen to his earlier music.\nThe obituaries tend to overlook that in the late 1950s, Jones studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Olivier Messiaen, then put together a cutting-edge 18-piece band. It fell apart on the road in Europe due to lack of funds. \"We had the best band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later said. \"That's when I discovered that there's music , and then there's the music business .\" The result, when Jones returned to L.A., was pop hits for Lesley Gore, a job at Mercury Records, the novelty hit \"Soul Bossa Nova,\" and arranging for Frank Sinatra.\nIn 1964, Sinatra asked Jones to turn a waltz called \"In Other Words\" into a swinger. The result was \"Fly Me To The Moon\" as we know it. The ultimate version is on Sinatra at the Sands. Jones's template is the Basie band's 1950s reincarnation with Billy May's arrangements. He builds through ripples of tenor saxes and trumpets, adds a featherlight '60s flute counterpoint to Sinatra's vocal, and then unleashes the elephant charge of the Basie band at full power. We actually hear Sinatra's delight.\nAnything Jones worked on between 1960 and 1980 is worth listening to. There's so much of it that the best gets overlooked, especially if it didn't sell well at the time. My nomination for the unfairly neglected Jones job? Aretha Franklin's 1972 album Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky). Perhaps the cumbrous title helps to explain why it was the first Franklin album not to make the Billboard Top 25, though the single \"Angel\" reached No. 1 on the R&B chart. It was Franklin's first Atlantic album without Jerry Wexler in the chair. Jones more than filled Wexler's spot.\nAretha Franklin and Quincy Jones could each do everything very well. Hey Now Hey has a bit of everything. The complex unfolding of the title track anticipates the gospel-disco stomp of Chaka Khan's \"Love Has Fallen On Me\" (1978). The jazz numbers, a discreetly flashy take on Leonard Bernstein's \"Somewhere\" and the Bebop standard \"Moody's Mood,\" are spacious and sophisticated. \"Sister From Texas\" goes harder than Otis Redding. The best track, though, is \"Mr. Spain.\"\nWritten by Carolyn Plummer, who had written \"Road Song\" for Wes Montgomery and cowrote \"Angel\" on this album, \"Mr. Spain\" is an eerie accounting of a love affair gone wrong. It is too fast for a ballad, too slow for a groove, definitely jazz but also something more: a crossroads of styles and emotions. Jones's orchestration sets the ambivalence of Plummer's lyrics and the wry passion of Franklin's vocal in a gilded swirl of strings. \"Mr. Spain\" is one of the great recordings of the 1970s. Quincy Jones made it happen.\nDominic Green is a Wall Street Journal contributor and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.",

        "summary": "SINGAPORE – In Tampines and Marine Parade GRCs, two new faces have featured on banners with elected MPs.\nDr Charlene Chen and Dr Choo Pei Ling are grassroots advisers in the two constituencies respectively.\nThe academics are among at least seven new faces in the PAP camp who have in the last 1½ years assumed leadership roles in opposition wards and almost every PAP-held constituency with empty seats.\nAll have been spotted alongside MPs at community events and made party branch chairs or grassroots advisers – roles sometimes held by those later fielded as candidates for the ruling party.\nOnly one spot, in West Coast GRC, remains publicly unspoken for. This is former transport minister S. Iswaran's seat, vacant since\nAnalysts say getting new faces on the ground early could give the People's Action Party (PAP) an edge in contested and opposition-held areas. For one thing, residents will have more time to get familiar with potential candidates, whose early start can signal a commitment by the party to winning over the voters.\nRefreshing the slate\nIn constituencies held by the Workers' Party (WP) – Hougang, Sengkang and Aljunied – the PAP has brought in new blood.\nTwo new faces\nMr Marcus Loh, a director at a digital transformation services firm, also\nMr Loh's move took place a week after trade unionist Jackson Lam was appointed Hougang branch chairman.\nUp-and-comers have also been seen in Jurong, Marine Parade and Tampines GRCs, which have one vacant seat each. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam\nTheir replacements are: orthopaedic surgeon Hamid Razak; Dr Choo, an assistant professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology's health and social sciences cluster; and Dr Chen, an assistant professor of marketing at Nanyang Technological University.\nAll three are active on the ground, and some, like Dr Choo, have got the public backing of party stalwarts.\nIn April, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong – who was active in Marine Parade for over 40 years –\nTwo months later, Prof Chen was\nAll three are second grassroots advisers (2GA).\nWhile the majority of grassroots volunteers do not stand for political office, some sitting MPs such as Tampines GRC's Desmond Choo and Nee Soon GRC's Carrie Tan have held the 2GA post before they stood for election.\nThe newly minted appointees told The Straits Times they have been working to connect with specific demographics.\nFor Mr Jackson Lam, this means Hougang's seniors and young people.\n'We are working closely with the active ageing centres in Hougang. We want to reach out to as many seniors as possible, and promote healthy active living,' he said.\n'At the same time, we actively reach out to the youth at rental blocks, such as during the festive seasons.'\nAssociate Professor Elmie, a communications expert from the National University of Singapore, said Sengkang's Malay community has been particularly welcoming and open to sharing their thoughts on issues.\n'(These) include international ones such as the wars and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as local issues like the lack of halal eateries in the neighbourhood,' he said.\nProf Elmie said his team is planning more programmes and assistance for residents.\n'Admittedly, there are limits to what I can do as a non-elected representative of the PAP in Sengkang,' he added.\n'While I cannot write to agencies to appeal for help on behalf of residents, I will try to better understand their problems and offer help within what I can.'\nGood to be seen early\nPublicly introducing potential candidates early may lead to more support at the ballot box, said political observers.\nFor one thing, they have more time to engage residents, and the party has a longer runway to gauge sentiments in the lead-up to the polls.\nSingapore Management University law don Eugene Tan said the PAP may want to give new faces time to know the ground better.\nIt would also want to avoid 'parachuting in' new candidates at opposition-held constituencies late, given the amount of legwork needed to wrestle these back, he added.\nEarly introductions can also help suss out sentiments on the ground, said independent political observer Felix Tan.\nHe said: 'If there are any shifts, there will still be time for the PAP to make changes to the candidates when the time for an election comes.'\nNUS' Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian added that this strategy ensures there are fewer surprises, as was the case with Mr Ivan Lim in GE2020.\nMr Lim had been formally introduced as part of the Jurong GRC team, but\nAn early start may also serve as a signal of political intent to defend vulnerable constituencies and win back lost ones.\nFormer PAP MP Inderjit Singh, who retired from politics in 2015, said the early introduction of teams in opposition-held constituencies 'shows PAP's seriousness about serving the constituency and to win back the seats'.\nThere is usually less pressure to do so in constituencies where the PAP is the incumbent, as other MPs in the constituency can stand in for those who have stepped down at Meet-the-People sessions and community events, Professor Tan noted.\nBut in the case of Marine Parade and Tampines, the PAP may face competition from the WP – the second-largest party in Parliament with 10 seats won at GE2020 – he noted.\nDuring GE2020, the PAP\nThe PAP fared better in Tampines against the National Solidarity Party, where it\nFinally, introducing potential candidates early may help them stand out among the ruling party's large slate. The PAP typically contests every elected seat in Parliament and refreshes about a third of its slate every general election.\nIn a large slate, it is easy for individual candidates to get lost in the crowd, Prof Chong said.\nOne downside of going public so early, though, is that potential candidates may become fodder for public and online debates.\n'Social media has always been unforgiving and toxic, and with these new faces or replacements coming to the fore, there will be more vitriol one might expect to see online,' Dr Tan said.\nWhat about West Coast?\nWest Coast GRC stands out. Unlike other constituencies, there is no clarity on who will fill the vacant seat left by former Cabinet minister Iswaran.\nOne possibility is entrepreneur Chua Wei-Shan, who is the Young PAP's organising secretary. Ms Chua was acting branch chairwoman in Iswaran's absence and has also been seen on the ground with MPs.\nBut she does not fulfil the GRC's ethnic minority requirement, necessitating a further reshuffle if she is fielded there.\nWest Coast saw the closest fight in GE2020, where the PAP line-up, anchored by Iswaran and National Development Minister Desmond Lee,\nThe Progress Singapore Party, led in its first hustings by former PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock, garnered 48.32 per cent of the vote.\n'The razor-thin victory margin means this GRC is vulnerable electorally for the PAP and the circumstances under which the GRC has one fewer PAP MP there does not help matters,' said Prof Tan, referring to Iswaran's criminal charges and subsequent jail sentence.\nProf Tan said the question for the party is whether it should deploy another heavyweight – such as a minister or popular backbencher – or a 'new face' to replace Iswaran.\nAn overly hasty announcement could tie its hands unnecessarily, he added.\nAnother factor could be the fate of the constituency itself.\nDr Felix Tan noted that it is possible the GRC could be carved up to become a smaller one by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee, with sections spliced out into SMCs or joining other GRCs.\nMr Singh has previously said changes in electoral boundaries in the west may be on the cards, due to a jump in voter numbers in Hong Kah North – which had a 65.33 per cent increase in voters between 2020 and 2024.\nThis may result in shifts in the boundaries of Jurong GRC and West Coast GRC.\nWP's guessing game\nAcross the aisle, the WP has not publicly introduced potential successors for its two empty seats in Parliament – Ms Raeesah Khan's seat in Sengkang and Mr Leon Perera's in Aljunied.\nMs Khan\nThe WP seems to also be weighing its options for Sengkang and Aljunied GRCs, and may not want to give its opponent time to scrutinise its replacements, said Prof Tan.\nThis adds to the WP's 'guessing game' with the ruling party. It is very likely that the replacements would be among its strongest candidates, which the party may not want to reveal yet, he added.\nDr Felix Tan noted that WP cadres and potential new candidates face much greater public scrutiny than those from the PAP.\n'There are probably some who are already considered for those seats, but the WP could be waiting for a more opportune time to reveal,' he said.\nMr Singh added: 'From their perspective, they will want to have an element of surprise so that the PAP will not have enough time to prepare a strategy to counter the particular candidate that will finally be sent.'\nAlso seen on the ground\nApart from those who have been formally appointed to their various positions, there are others who have also been spotted on the ground.\nLeaders from the civil service, the private sector and non-profits have been seen with PAP MPs at political party walkabouts and community events.\nPossibly the most senior former civil servant to appear alongside PAP MPs so far is Singapore Business Federation chief executive officer Kok Ping Soon.\nMr Kok, who was until 2023 the chief executive of the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), has been pictured with Nee Soon MP Derrick Goh since September, attending various events including North West Service Week, a quarterly assistance programme for those living in public rental flats.\nThe 53-year-old has been chairman of Nee Soon Link Citizens Consultative Committee – a grassroots outfit – since June 2024.\nMr Kok has also sat on the boards of various agencies and institutes, including the Infocomm Media Development Authority and the Defence Science and Technology Agency.\nHe started his career at the Economic Development Board, and also held positions such as deputy secretary at the Ministry of Manpower.\nFrom the private sector, shipping lawyer Gho Sze Kee, 45, has been seen alongside Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan in photos since August.\nShe has accompanied Mr Lim to numerous events such as National Day celebrations with Thye Hua Kwan Active Ageing Centre and the Mountbatten Active Ageing Committee. She also attended a Deepavali light-up event in Jalan Batu with him in October.\nMs Gho is a long-term party volunteer who was among the speakers at the 2021 PAP party convention, where the then Bukit Timah branch secretary called for the inclusion of diverse voices across its ranks.\nIt is unclear if she is still in that role, but checks show she was still active in the area in the past year, as she received a Public Service Medal in 2023 as vice-chairwoman of the Bukit Timah Citizens Consultative Committee.\nShe is currently associate director at Messrs Asialegal, a boutique law firm that specialises in maritime law.\nMr Gabriel Lam, chief operating officer of Shalom Movers, was spotted at a Housing Board roadshow for Tampines GreenCrest residents with Senior Minister of State for Manpower and Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon in September.\nMr Lam, who is in his early 40s, was previously involved in Chong Pang grassroots work, taking on roles such as vice-chairman of the ward's National Day dinner in 2023.\nHis LinkedIn biography says he is 'passionate about giving back to society and to help the less fortunate', and that he 'dedicates his free time to community-related volunteerism and is a grassroots leader'.\nAlso seen in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and Aljunied GRC is Dr Adrian Ang, a director at Chye Thiam Maintenance, a facility and environmental management company.\nThe 41-year-old was photographed with Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MPs during a market visit in April.\nIn a Lianhe Zaobao report that month, Mr Saktiandi Supaat said Dr Ang was a grassroots leader in Toa Payoh West, which Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat looks after.\nDr Ang, who was formerly a lecturer and section head at Temasek Polytechnic, is the secretary of the Toa Payoh West-Thomson Citizens Consultative Committee and branch secretary.\nHe was also in August appointed to the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council's tender and contracts committee as vice-chairman.\nMore recently, Dr Ang was pictured alongside Mr Victor Lye – who has contested Aljunied GRC since 2015 – at home visits in late October. Some pictures, posted by Mr Lye on social media, show Dr Ang wearing a shirt with the PAP logo and the word 'Aljunied' below it.\nAlso in the mix is Mr David Hoe, who is principal business architect at energy company YTL PowerSeraya.\nMr Hoe, 36, has been pictured alongside Jalan Besar GRC MP Denise Phua at various walkabouts, at times donning a PAP badge on his shirt as at one Pek Kio Market visit in June.\nHe has also been a district councillor for Central Singapore Community Development Council since 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Ms Phua is the mayor for the Central Singapore district.\nMr Hoe scored poorly for his Primary School Leaving Examination, but worked his way to university and became a Ministry of Education scholarship holder and teacher.\nOne potential face from the non-profit sector is Madam Hazlina Abdul Halim, chief executive officer of Make-A-Wish Singapore.\nThe 39-year-old was pictured in photos with Marine Parade GRC MPs at the Harmony Fiesta in Marine Parade in September, as well in posts by MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling.\nMadam Hazlina, who started her career as a journalist at Mediacorp, was formerly the president of PPIS (Singapore Muslim Women's Association) from 2020 to 2024, and is currently also a director of Mendaki, among other roles.\nThe Straits Times has reached out to all of them for comments.\nFrom the opposition, Mr Perera, 54, the former Aljunied GRC MP, has been spotted at Progress Singapore Party (PSP) events, and is volunteering with them.\nHe had resigned from the WP after an affair between him and WP Youth chair Nicole Seah came to light in July 2023.\nHe is not currently a member of the party, a PSP spokesperson said in mid-October.",

No problem, we will see it,\" said CM Soren. Earlier, CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat questioned the timings of the raid as the polling date for the state assembly nears and said that the Election Commission should stop such things.She further alleged that the BJP has become \"helpless\" which is why they are bringing ED and CBI.Speaking to ANI, Brinda Karat said, \"... BJP has become so helpless here in Jharkhand because they can see people are not responding to their hate politics. This is why they have brought in ED and CBI. The Election Commission should also stop this. How can they get an IT raid conducted at the last moment right before the elections? Why? If there was something, they could have gone to the court or had asked about a case. This is wrong and we condemn this. It shows that BJP is using its actual alliance (ED, CBI and Income Tax) when people are not coming in the rallies of big BJP leaders.\"\nMeanwhile, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Manoj Pandey questioned the \"motive\" behind the raids carried out by the Income Tax department with the polling date for the state assembly nears.Speaking to ANI on Saturday, Pandey said, \"At whose behest is this happening? What is the motive behind this? People are not coming to BJP rallies while they are coming to the rallies of Hemant Soren and Kalpana Soren, this has caused frustration among them (BJP).\"\nThe Income Tax department raided the residence of Sunil Srivastava on today's morning, allegedly a close aide and personal secretary of Jharkhand CM Soren.\nNotably, this comes days ahead of the assembly elections in Jharkhand. CM Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), in alliance with Congress, RJD and left parties is facing major competition from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA alliance in the state.The 81-member Jharkhand Assembly will go to polls in two phases on November 13 and 20, with vote counting scheduled for November 23.

        "summary": "Arnold Moyo served in the British Army from February 2008 to August 2013. During this time, he was injured during training in Wales.\nIn early February 2024, Arnold lost his job, was unable to find housing and became homeless – during which time he slept rough.\nThrough the Office for Veterans' Affairs-funded housing pathway Op FORTITUDE and SSAFA, Arnold accessed temporary accommodation and was referred into Riverside's specialist supported housing for veterans, Mike Jackson House (MJH).\nWhen you walk through the streets and you see people with sleeping bags, you might think: how can this be in the United Kingdom? How could this person become homeless?\nBut what those people don't realise is that any person can become homeless at any time. Not everyone on the streets is there because of drugs or alcohol, you can end up there because of severe PTSD after seeing your friend lose a limb.\nI chose to join the British Army in 2008 and I think it was the best decision I ever made. It transformed my life and changed my perspective on everything.\nI'm from the Commonwealth and there is so much diversity that people don't always see from the outside. There are no barriers to entry in the British military and I am very much grateful for what this country has offered me\nBut when I left in 2013, I was oblivious to what the British military could offer in terms of opportunity and personal growth. Things have changed now, but I wish someone had spoken to us about personal development in terms of your own welfare.\nThe mistake many people make when they join the military is not saving money, because when you're there everything is subsidised, you're living on a base. But then you realise three quarters into your career that you haven't got a house and by the time you start thinking about a mortgage it's too late.\nRight after I left things became very difficult. I had a young family, but my ex-wife and I struggled to adapt to life outside the military and soon after leaving we separated after 10 years.\nAfter the divorce, it became very hard to try and cope with life. I don't drink, I don't smoke, so, one might ask: how did you not save? But the military had consumed me, I had been spoon-fed for many years and I was oblivious to the world outside.\nAt one stage I lost a work contract and I became homeless. It was an extremely difficult time. It was very hard to explain to somebody how I'd ended up there because of what I used to do. I think it was nativity.\nI went to the council to try and get accommodation, but I couldn't. I ended up on the streets.\nThank God I phoned SSAFA, which works in conjunction with the British Legion, and booked into a hotel for the next coming few weeks. They then made a referral to MJH through Op FORTITUDE.\nIn my view, OP FORTITUDE is one of the best organisations out there for military veterans – and there are a lot of homeless veterans out there.\nTo any military veterans out there, I want to say that it's never too late and you need to articulate your problem to someone. Always reach out for help, because there is always going to be someone there to help you.\n– Arnold Moyo\nWithout MJH, Arnold says he might still be living on the streets. It has given him a safe place to live, mental stability and has helped Arnold secure funds to support a quick return back to employment.\nIn November 2024, Arnold started a 5-week course to become a Retrofit Assessor.\nTomorrow we mark Remembrance Sunday, a time to come together to pay tribute to all those who have served to protect the freedoms we have today.\n'Remembrance Day means quite a lot to me as someone from the Commonwealth - who was integrated into the British military. Without the sacrifices of those who defended and protected Great Britain from attack I wouldn't have been part of this multi-cultural and diverse nation.' Arnold Moyo",

        "summary": "Akola: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday said wherever a Congress government is formed, that state becomes the ATM (Automated Teller Machine) of the party's 'shahi parivar'.\nWe won't let Maharashtra become the ATM of Congress, Modi asserted while addressing a campaign rally in Akola for the November 20 state Assembly elections.\nWhen the Congress indulges in so much corruption to win polls, one can imagine how corrupt the party will be once in power, the PM pointed out.\n'Wherever the Congress forms a government, that state becomes the ATM of the party's shahi parivar. As much as Rs 700 crore has been extorted from the liquor business in (Congress-ruled) Karnataka for the Maharashtra polls. Telangana and Himachal Pradesh have also become this shahi parivar's ATMs,' he said.\nThe PM said the manifesto of the Mahayuti (ruling alliance in Maharashtra) focuses on women's security, job opportunities, expansion of Ladki Bahin Yojana, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprising the Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP, have come out with a 'ghotala patra'.\n'The entire country knows the MVA means corruption, token money and transfer posting business,' he said.\nAttacking the Congress, the PM said he was daring the party's shahi parivar to prove if they had ever visited Babasaheb Ambedkar's 'panchteerth'.\nModi has coined the term panchteerth to denote Ambedkar's birthplace in Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, the place in London where he stayed while studying in the UK, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur where he embraced Buddhism, his 'Mahaparinirvan Sthal' in Delhi, and 'Chaitya Bhoomi' in Mumbai.\n'They hate Babasaheb because he was a Dalit and because he got credit for drafting the Constitution. Babasaheb is an inspiration for me, the BJP and my government. Our government has developed places attached to his legacy. I have even named our UPI as BHIM UPI,' he said.\nThe Congress' game plan is to pit castes and communities against each other and not allow Dalits and backward groups to unite, but the people of Haryana foiled this conspiracy by following the 'Ek hai to safe hai' (we are safe if we are united) mantra, Modi said.\n'The Congress wants the OBCs, Adivasis and Dalits to fight as a split in their votes will get it back to power. This is the chaal and charitra (guile and character) of the Congress. In riots in Haryana, Dalits were killed and the Congress stood by the perpetrators,' the PM said.\nThe Congress knows it will be strengthened only if the country is weakened, he added.\nModi said in his last two terms his government was able to provide houses to four crore poor people, while another three crore houses will be built hereon.\nIn his third term, Modi said projects costing several lakh crore are underway, including the Vadhavan Port in Maharashtra which when completed will be the largest in the country.\nSuch welfare work brings him blessings of the people and 'your vote helps Modi work for the poor', he asserted.\nWhile the NDA government is working to make cotton farmers of Maharashtra prosperous, the MVA government stalled irrigation projects started by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government.\n'We are encouraging farmers to irrigate farms with less water. Our motto is more crop per drop. We want to empower farmers so that they become the heroes of the country's development. The NDA government is working with speed and I want Maharashtra to have a similar government,' Modi said.\nModi said the Congress and its allies ignored the demand to bestow classical language status on Marathi, which he was fortunate to fulfil in his third term.\n'On this day in 2019, the Supreme Court of the country gave its verdict on Ram Temple. This date of November 9 will also be remembered because after the decision of the Supreme Court, people of every religion showed great sensitivity,' Modi said.\n'This feeling of nation first is the biggest strength of India,' he said.\nThe PM slammed the Congress for supporting the resolution in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly for restoration of Article 370, which gave the erstwhile state special status.\n'These people are speaking the language of anti-India forces and want to push Kashmir back into violence and militancy. They want to take Ambedkar's Constitution out of J-K. After Article 370 was removed, Dalits and tribals there got reservations. Kashmiri Hindus fled due to Article 370,' he said.\n'In the 10 years from 2014 to 2024, Maharashtra has continuously blessed the BJP wholeheartedly. There is a reason behind Maharashtra's trust in BJP. The reason for this is the patriotism, political understanding and vision of the people of Maharashtra,' Modi said.\nOn November 20, people of Maharashtra have the opportunity to give direction to the state and country by choosing development, security and peace, he said.\nAssembly poll results will be declared on November 23.\nPTI Tags: IndiaNarendra ModiPOLITICS",

        "summary": "1 of 2\nSusan Spear\nGREENSBORO — Nearly $4 million in federal grant funds awarded to the Greensboro Police Department will allow the agency to bolster its workforce with 30 new officers, target auto-related theft, and increase officer visibility downtown, according to Chief John Thompson.\nThe Cops Hiring Program, or CHP, a Department of Justice initiative begun 20 years ago, helps pinpoint need and directs grants to beef up police forces around the country.\nThe $3.7 million infusion should cover 75% of 30 new officers' salaries for about three years, according to Greensboro Police. The city will take care of the balance, officials said. COPS bestowed $8.6 million to law enforcement agencies statewide, and Greensboro won the largest piece of the pie.\n'Our City Council and City leadership has fully supported our efforts to keep starting salaries competitive, which has made a significant difference in our ability to recruit and retain skilled officers. As a result of that support, we have about 30 cadets in the academy, and another 30 going through their post-academy field training,'' Thompson said in a Thursday email.\n'That will leave us with only 13 vacancies for sworn positions. This grant will allow us to add 30 more positions and better address some of the community's areas of concern, such as traffic and auto-related crimes,'' the chief said, explaining he hoped to stem thefts of property, including weapons, from vehicles, as well as the theft of vehicles.\n'We also are looking at potentially using some of those new positions to increase our visibility downtown, which continues to grow and attract new businesses.'\nDowntown recently saw the shooting death of a homeless man outside the Interactive Resources Center on Washington Street, an agency that had served the 25-year-old victim, police said.\nNew officers would join a force already 670-strong. Currently, there are about 13 vacancies for officers, Greensboro Police said, the lowest vacancies have been since before 2020, according to news reports.\nThompson, who became chief in 2022, was seriously understaffed from the start. That year, the department was about 130 officers short of a full roster.\nNow, the department is attracting and retaining more officers in a hiring climate that is competitive across the region.\nThe starting salary for a police officer with the Greensboro Police Department is $57,220 if an officer is still in the Police Academy. After completing the academy, the annual salary is over $59,500. Information about when hiring will begin was not immediately available.\nBy Oct. 17, Greensboro, had counted 34 homicides for the year so far, compared to 54 at this same in September 2023, records and news reports show.",

Several videos and photos of the duo were posted on social media platforms. (Also Read | Lekha Washington goes Insta official with Imran Khan; drops her first romantic photo with him)\nImran Khan and his girlfriend, Lekha Washington, posed for the camera outside a building. Imran and Lekha go out for a date\nIn a video, Imran and Lekha were seen walking out of the room. As he started walking, Imran held out his hand and Lekha held it while smiling at him. The duo then posed for the paparazzi. Imran also placed his hand on his chest while thanking a paparazzo.\nIn another clip, Lekha was seen hugging a girl and then punching her. She then quickly walked away. For the outing, Imran wore a black T-shirt, brown leather jacket and jeans. Lekha was seen wearing a black top and pants. The duo watched Khwaabon Ka Jhamela. Directed by Danish Aslam, the film stars Prateik Babbar, Sayani Gupta and Danish Husain.\nImran's relationship with Lekha\nRecently, Imran confirmed his relationship with Lekha Washington. Speaking in an interview with Vogue India, Imran had said, 'The speculation that I am romantically involved with Lekha Washington is true. I have been divorced and separated since February 2019.'\n'There's this story that Lekha is a homewrecker, which infuriates me because not only is it misogynistic, but it also takes away my agency as an individual. Lekha and I became close during the confinement, a year and a half after my separation from Avantika and almost a year after she separated from her partner, and not from her husband as was widely reported, he added.\nAbout Avantika and Imran\nImran married Avantika Malik in 2011. They divorced in 2019. They are parents to a daughter, Imara. Rumors about their separation started in 2019, but neither Imran nor Avantika made any comments on the matter.

What is that?'\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nMr Ribbons replied: 'It means that it is income that has been budgeted for.'\nSimply put, it has not met revenue expectations.\nAsked if they were doing anything to change that, Greg Welsh, head of primary education within whose remit the Burgh Halls sits, said: 'Officers are currently undertaking work to look at a longer term business plan for the Burgh Halls and that is set to come before the Corporate Policy PDSP by the turn of the year.'\nLabour Councillor Tom Conn also questioned the overspend, saying: 'This is a target which is assigned and not met. If targets are increased and the previous target has not been met, are we not creating the problem?\n'If the targets are failing then it has nothing to do with the facility, it is to do with the expectation of the targets.'\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nMr Welsh said the income target would be addressed as part of its future plan.\nCouncillor Danny Logue asked whether someone with retail hospitality experience should be involved at the Burgh Halls as there had been when similar problems were identified at the Howden Park Centre in Livingston.\nLinlithgow's Lib Dem Sally Pattle defended staff saying: 'I'd like to reassure Councillor Logue that they really are experts at what they do. The packages they deliver are top class, particularly in the context of West Lothian.'\nCouncillor Pattle first called for reports on the future of the Burgh Halls in February after a projected loss of £77,000 was revealed at the venue which is marketed for weddings and gatherings.\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nCouncillor Conn followed up with a call for reassurances that a 'holistic' review be delivered of how the Burgh Halls was used.\nThere has also been criticism of opening hours and, within Linlithgow, criticism that the venue is not managed or promoted properly by the council, stuck as it is in the educational services portfolio.",

        "summary": "Bangladesh's Hindu Minority (Photo - Web)\nIn yet another grim escalation of anti-Hindu violence, an Islamic extremist mob attacked a Hindu temple in the Shibatala Karmakar area of Chapainawabganj district, sending shockwaves through the vulnerable Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Reports indicate that the army has arrived on the scene, but, astonishingly, they are failing to provide the crucial assistance needed by the besieged community. Instead, helpless members of the temple committee have taken to the streets in protest, decrying the army's indifference to their plight.\nThe International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a globally recognized Hindu Vaishnavite organization, now finds itself at the center of a coordinated assault in Bangladesh. For months, ISKCON has served as a unifying force for the Hindu minority, providing resistance against a wave of violence that is being fueled by radical Islamist groups like Hifazat-e-Islam. In recent days, the extremists have intensified their campaign, with Hifazat-e-Islam openly calling for attacks against ISKCON and spreading incitement through social media channels, even brazenly invoking the memory of the infamous Noakhali massacre to instill terror in Bangladesh's Hindu community.\nTensions escalated in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong as security forces launched a massive crackdown on the minority Hindu community following clashes sparked by a social media post. The incident began on November 5 in the Hazari Gali area when Osman Ali, a member of the radical Islamic group Jamat-e-Islami, posted derogatory remarks against the Hindu religion and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) on social media.\nFootage of the incident showed scenes of chaos, with security personnel clashing with civilians, chasing them, and hitting them with batons.\nISKCON is far from a political threat; it is an esteemed spiritual organization with a presence in over 76 countries, promoting universal principles of peace and unity through the Hare Krishna Movement. In Bangladesh, ISKCON's outreach extends beyond spiritual gatherings to humanitarian work, assisting communities in need, particularly during natural disasters. Yet, this internationally respected institution now faces an unprovoked assault because its monks and Brahmacharis have dared to speak out against the brutal persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh.\nAs extremists rallied in Chattogram from Teri Bazar to Cheragi, their chilling slogans echoed through the streets, inciting violence with chants such as, 'There is no place for ISKCON in this Bangla; burn down ISKCON, torch ISKCON's addresses; raze down ISKCON, demolish ISKCON's addresses.' These violent calls to action are nothing short of a national disgrace, yet the Bangladeshi government remains disturbingly silent, seemingly content to watch as its extremist factions terrorize its own citizens.\nThis escalating violence against ISKCON is emblematic of the broader failure of the Bangladeshi government to protect its minority communities from rising religious extremism. Instead of confronting this menace, Bangladeshi authorities appear more concerned with appeasing radical elements, effectively condoning the persecution of Hindus under the guise of 'maintaining order.' Such inaction lays bare a damning truth: the government's complacency has emboldened extremists, leaving Bangladeshi Hindus at the mercy of mobs intent on erasing them from the nation.",

        "summary": "Social Sharing\nCanada's borders are \"safe and secure,\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday as she sought to address fears that U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's vow to deport millions of undocumented immigrants could send a wave of migrants north.\nRCMP officials have said they've been preparing for months for the possibility of increased migrant traffic at the border as the undocumented flee the United States.\nIn an interview with CBC's The House, Freeland said her message is that \"Canada controls our borders. Every Canadian has the absolute right to expect that our country chooses who comes here and who doesn't.\"\n\"I want people to know their borders are safe and secure and they will continue to be, come what may in the world,\" Freeland told host Catherine Cullen.\n'We control our borders': Freeland responds to questions about border security in wake of U.S. election\n12 hours ago\nDuration 2:37\nIn an interview with Catherine Cullen, host of CBC Radio's The House, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said her message to the rest of the world is that Canada welcomes newcomers in an 'organized, systematic way.'\nIt's not guaranteed that Trump will actually carry out the mass deportation, but his allies have mentioned Canada as a potential destination if the undocumented are forced out of the United States.\n\"Where do you think the illegal immigrants are going to flee to when our southern border is shut down? The northern border,\" Kelly Craft, Trump's former ambassador to Canada, said Tuesday. \"So Canada needs to be prepared.\"\nThe Pew Research Centre estimates the unauthorized immigrant population in the United States grew to 11 million in 2022.\nRCMP Sgt. Charles Poirier told CBC News Network on Friday that officers are looking at getting more police cruisers, permanent or semi-permanent buildings and chartering some buses to ferry the migrants if they cross the border.\n\"Obviously, we don't wish for this to happen, but should it happen, at least we'll be ready,\" Poirier said.\nAlthough authorities are already preparing for an influx of migrants, one refugee advocate said the concern is overblown and he questions why Canadian politicians are giving it oxygen.\nAbdulla Daoud, executive director of The Refugee Centre in Montreal, told The House he doesn't think Trump's promise of a mass deportation will change much for Quebec or Canada.\nDaoud said that \"policy takes time\" and any surge of migrants would \"probably be over a very long period of time. We won't see millions of people show up to our borders overnight.\"\nDaoud also argued that Trump has never specified if he'll send undocumented immigrants to Quebec or Canada at large. He said it's \"odd\" for Canadian politicians to suggest the country will be affected by Trump's promise.\nIn Quebec, Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon has warned that millions of people might consider moving north after Trump's election. Quebec Premier François Legault said he would press Trudeau to \"make sure he protects the border.\"\n\"So it's unfortunately not the leadership we would like to see in Canada,\" Daoud said. \"We can't play into that polarization because it's not a good way to deal with the policy changes that are going to happen in the next four years.\"\nDaoud said that if there's an increase in migrants coming north, Canada would need to \"look at our infrastructure and see how it's built out to accommodate that increase.\"\nTrump's win and Ukraine\nTrump's return to the White House may also shake up Russia's war on Ukraine. The president-elect has vowed to end the war and has even promised to do it in as little as 24 hours — raising fears that Ukraine could be forced into negotiations.\nWhen asked whether she believes Trump's vow to end the war so quickly, Freeland did not answer directly. She said the people \"who I think we all need to be listening to when it comes to Ukraine are the Ukrainians.\"\n\"People outside Ukraine have consistently undermined the Ukrainians,\" Freeland said, adding that experts informed her when the war began that Kyiv would \"fall in a week.\"\n\"Let's recognize what a great job [the Ukrainians] have done. Let's continue to support them,\" she said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly react to Trump's win, praising the victory on social media and applauding Trump's commitment to achieving \"peace through strength.\"\nIhor Michalchyshyn, executive director of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC), said he can't speculate on what Trump meant by his promise to end the war in a day.\nHe said that Trump is \"inheriting a situation that is critical to American security\" and the UCC is \"hopeful that the president-elect will be developing a strong relationship with the Ukrainian government.\"\nMichalchyshyn said there is \"strong\" bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States and \"we hope that will guide the actions of the future.\"",

        "summary": "Ottawa is finalizing its long-awaited Arctic foreign policy with Inuit leaders for release before the end of the year, as Canada braces for a second Trump presidency and increasing threats to its sovereignty from China and Russia.\nInuit leaders and federal ministers met in Ottawa Friday to go over the details of the policy, which are expected to include the reinstatement of an Arctic ambassador.\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree told CBC News that Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly is working with Inuit partners on naming someone to the position.\nEarlier this fall, the U.S. federal government appointed Michael Sfraga as the first U.S. ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs.\n\"It would only be strategic, I think, for us to as a country ... play more of a diplomatic space with our allies and all other nation states,\" said Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK).\nWhoever is named to the role will face serious challenges, including pressure from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump for Canada to increase defence spending, tension over Indigenous rights and threats from China and Russia.\n\"We're investing in the Arctic,\" Joly told reporters in French on Friday. \"That is what the United States expects Canada to do and that's why we are convinced our approach to defence is also a win-win position.\"\nCanada's new defence policy, which commits to an additional $73 billion in defence spending over the next two decades, focuses on threats to the Arctic. It's intended to bring Canada closer to meeting NATO's military spending target for member states of two per cent of national gross domestic product — but Canada won't reach that goal until the 2030s.\nRob Huebert, interim director of the Centre for Military Security and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary, said there's a real danger of Canada being seen as a free rider.\n\"Canadian governments tend to talk big about the protection of Arctic sovereignty, but they tend to be quite short on actions,\" he said.\n\"To think that our enemies are going to wait for us until the 2030s to be prepared, I mean, that's just silly.\"\nCanada facing challenge from U.S.\nHuebert said the Arctic is ground zero for mitigating threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is increasingly talking about launching nuclear weapons from Russia's Far North.\nHe said Beijing is signalling it intends to follow Russia's lead and take back territories that it feels were unfairly taken from China, such as Taiwan. If that happens, he said, the Chinese may launch deployments in the Arctic as a distraction to dilute the concentration of American forces in the Indo-Pacific.\n\"It's about drawing the Americans away,\" Huebert said.\nCanada is ill-prepared to face the challenges ahead, he added.\nChina is building icebreakers — including one with a deep-diving submersible Huebert said could put deep-sea cables at risk.\nOttawa is also building new icebreakers and plans to replace its submarine fleet, but the long-range missile tracking system it's developing for the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in the Arctic won't be fully operational until 2033.\nCanada may also face friction with the U.S. over the Northwest Passage. Former U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo rejected Canada's claims to the sea lane as \"illegitimate\" during Trump's first term in the White House.\nInuit leaders have worked with Joly and her team at Global Affairs on developing the new Arctic foreign policy since the spring. Obed said it will be a progressive strategy that will allow for Inuit participation in foreign conversations that affect the Arctic.\nInuit leaders hope for new infrastructure\nObed said Canada can innovate in the way it partners with Indigenous people — and move beyond a troubled history that ignored Inuit participation and even relocated Inuit from northern Quebec to the High Arctic to assert Arctic sovereignty for Canada.\n\"I truly hope that we can move away from the idea that our communities are of no consequence to the militarization of the Arctic,\" Obed said.\n\"This policy and the ongoing positive relationship between the Government of Canada and Inuit allows for us to get beyond that legacy of shocking disrespect for our human rights and gets us into a place where we are rightfully a part of the conversation.\"\nWith the development of new defence facilities in the Arctic, Inuit leaders are hoping the federal government will also build new roads, water and sewer infrastructure in their communities.\nThey're also looking for shared use of new marine ports and hangers — which could be tricky when Canada gets its first delivery of new F-35 fighters in 2026, since they require enhanced security.\nAnandasangaree said anything Canada builds in the Arctic needs to be accepted by local communities.\n\"We can't continue to have a colonial attitude towards the North and particularly towards Inuit,\" he said.",

This is meant to ensure adequate supplies for the 2024-2025 summer cropping season.\nThe announcement was made by Minister of Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion, Mthuli Ncube, through Statutory Instrument 178 of 2024, published in the Government Gazette on November 8.\nUnder the new regulations, licensed and approved importers who bring in duty-free fertiliser but then sell it at the same or higher price than those who have paid duty will be required to pay the full duty, along with penalties.\nMinister Ncube also stated that the list of reputable importers authorized to benefit from the duty suspension will be approved by the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development, Anxious Masuka.

        "summary": "Assembly Elections 2024 | The Maharashtra Assembly polls will take place against the backdrop of a fractured political landscape in the western state where the Shiv Sena and NCP will be going up against the Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar factions, even as the BJP and Congress try to make their mark. Meanwhile, in Jharkhand, the JMM faces a new challenge after Hemant Soren's recent arrest and Champai, a longstanding party member, joining the BJP. The Haryana election resulted in a shock loss for Congress, which was looking to galvanize on the Lok Sabha poll performance, while J&K also saw the grand old party eventually stepping away from the cabinet, with Omar Abdullah 's JKNC forming government. It remains to be seen if the upcoming polls help BJP cement its position further or provide a fillip to I.N.D.I.A.

        "summary": "President Recep Tayyip Erdoan participated in the 6th International Summit on Women and Justice organized by the Women and Democracy Foundation (KADEM) in collaboration with the Ministry of Family and Social Services on the theme of Artificial Intelligence and Women at the University of Hali. President Erdoan was accompanied by his wife Emine Erdoan, Minister of Labor and Social Security Vedat Ikhan, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Brahim Yumakl, Istanbul Governor Davut Gl and Provincial Chairman of the AK Party 'Istanbul, Osman Nuri Kabaktepe.\nRevna Demirren, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Demirren Holding Meltem Demirren, Member of the Board of Directors of Demirren Holding Murat Oktay also attended the Summit on Artificial Intelligence and Women, of which Demirren Media was one of communications sponsors. During the program, a film about KADEM's activities in Türkiye and abroad was shown.\nTHE FACT THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ENLARGES INJUSTICE IS SOMETIMES NOTICED\nSpeaking on the broadcast, President Erdoan said: 'We live in an era where digital culture has changed people's perception of life. Aside from the products, opportunities and conveniences that digitalization brings, we see very clearly that it objectifies human beings and obscures their uniqueness. A multidimensional digital hegemony is increasingly penetrating our lives and expanding its sphere of influence day by day. Another point in this context is that the aspect of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, which aggravates injustices is sometimes ignored. However, research shows that artificial intelligence reinforces social inequalities by repeating bad practices. I must say that women occupy the first place among the victims of artificial intelligence technologies and algorithms. From job applications to social media platforms, women are frequently exposed to the ugly face of artificial intelligence that increases inequality. We can benefit from artificial intelligence not only to prevent disadvantage, but also to enable women to access equal rights and self-improvement. For this, it is necessary to determine the basic principles that favor disadvantaged groups in artificial intelligence algorithms. We believe that a universal declaration should be signed on this issue before more victimization occurs and the problems become chronic.\nWE FACED SERIOUS OBSTACLES FOR 22 YEARS\nEmphasizing that he fought for women's rights, Erdoan said: Over the past 22 years in Türkiye, women are among the segments we have affected the most. When we look back, one of the struggles we are proud of is the determined, hard and painful fight we waged to expand women's rights and freedoms. Yes, we really had a lot of difficulties. For 22 years, we have faced very serious obstacles. We faced all kinds of supervision, oppression and prohibitionist mentalities that penetrated even into the cells. We have always encountered opposition against us in our efforts to provide women with the rights they should already have. Unfortunately, despite the clear provisions of our Constitution, women have been excluded from education and professional life in this country for years simply because of their headscarves. Persuasion rooms have been set up at the gates of universities, at the gates of fascism. Women could not work freely in our private sector organizations which behaved in a more royalist manner than the king. She was forced to choose between her profession and her faith. As IBB President and Prime Minister, we also faced the impositions of the former Türkiye. As a result of our struggle over the past 22 years, we left all this behind as bad memories of Turkish democracy. All obstacles have been removed for the enrichment of the human industry of our country in all areas, particularly in education and professional life.\nWE HAVE INCREASED EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN\nPresident Erdoan said: 'We have addressed in particular the mistreatment of women and children with a zero-tolerance approach. In this direction, we have implemented revolutionary practices such as women's guest houses and electronic handcuffs. We have witnessed and are witnessing positive reflections in all areas, particularly in that of employment. Significant progress has been made regarding female labor force participation rates. In 2002, the participation rate, which was 27.9 percent, increased to 37.3 percent in August 2024. The employment rate for women increased from 25.3 percent to 33 percent. We say we haven't seen these numbers. Our goal is to increase the female labor force participation rate above 40 percent and the employment rate above 36 percent by the end of 2028. Wars, conflicts and destruction do not strike only cities, countries and households. They also target the innocent, the defenseless, the elderly, children and especially women. We have painfully experienced this reality in many conflict zones, from Syria to Afghanistan, from Yemen to Ukraine. However, we cannot remember any other war in recent years where women and children were targeted as much as the genocide in Gaza. From hospitals to schools, from tents to queues, from places of worship to homes, we face a deadly network that attacks, shoots and kills with the heaviest weapons.\nTwo-thirds of the more than 50,000 innocent people massacred in Gaza over the past 13 months are women and children. Despite this, under the shadow of weapons, in poverty, women who try to live, to stay alive, to protect their homes, to feed their children, are literally making history. The valiant women of Gaza, Palestine, who protect their children, their families, their homes and their cause under the bombs and guns in Gaza, become a monument of pride for the Ummah.\nWe expect Trump to abandon the previous administration's flawed policies.\nPresident Erdoan said Gaza was at the top of our agenda at the 11th Leaders' Summit of the Organization of Turkic States and the 5th Meeting of the European Political Community. On Wednesday evening, while I was in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, I had a telephone conversation with Mr. Trump, the President-elect of the United States of America, during which we both congratulated on his historic election victory and drew attention to the massacre in Gaza and Lebanon. We hope that my dear friend Mr. Trump, during his second presidential term, will abandon the misguided policies of the previous administration. We sincerely believe that Mr. President will take the initiative to end wars and we sincerely hope that he will do so. We will do everything possible to prevent further bloodshed and to ensure that these conflicts, wars and tensions, which destroy the lives of women and children, continue. May God help us and help us. Today, I sincerely congratulate Azerbaijan, which celebrates with great enthusiasm and pride the 4th anniversary of the Karabakh Victory and the Victory Day of the Azerbaijani people. I mercifully remember all our beloved martyrs who wrote their names with honor in history, and I wish their noble souls rest in peace. We will always remember with gratitude those heroes who gave their lives so that the crescent moon floats in the sky of Karabakh. Just as Karabakh was liberated after 30 years of occupation amid daily suffering, I believe that Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories will one day taste freedom. We will work with determination, patience and unwavering faith for this blessed day to come. We will continue our struggle on the basis of law and equity, he said.",

According to officials, he is expected to be transferred to the Western District of Washington for his initial arraignment, where details of the alleged scam will be further scrutinised.\nThe Justice Department's indictment outlines that Nwadialo used various aliases, including 'Giovanni,' to connect with victims on dating platforms like Match, Zoosk, and Christian Café.\nPosing as a military personnel deployed overseas, he allegedly avoided meeting his victims in person, instead creating compelling, fictitious scenarios to persuade them to send money.\n'Using these personas, Nwadialo invented many reasons he needed the victims to send him money,' the Justice Department stated.\nOne example involved a claim that the military had fined him for revealing his location to a victim, resulting in a request for $150,000. The victim, deceived by the story, reportedly lost $2.4 million.\nAnother account describes how Nwadialo convinced a different victim to move $330,000 from U.S. accounts to those he controlled under the pretext of funeral costs for his father.\n'Nwadialo represented that he needed help moving money due to his father's death,' the statement added.\nIn a separate instance, Nwadialo reportedly promised a third victim returns on a cryptocurrency investment. Controlling the victim's account, he redirected $270,000 for personal use.\nAssistant United States Attorney Sok Jiang is prosecuting the case, marking it as a notable example of cross-border financial crimes that prey on vulnerable individuals through deceptive online relationships.",

That means that more savings are now required to allow the council to balance its budget – something the council is legally required to do.\nTwo key areas are fuelling the overspend – homeless accommodation and care of the elderly. All councils have a legal duty to provide temporary accommodation to anyone presenting as homeless and, on average, 187 clients per night were accommodated in B&B between April and September.\nThe increasing elderly population means that demand is increasing for services such as care homes and additional agency/locum costs, and housing with care services.\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nThe forecast position for the council's adults and older people service is an overspend of over £6 million.\nThere is significant growth in commissioned adult social care, in demand for packages of care, both due to client numbers and overall individual complexity, with forecast overspend of £5.119 million.\nMr Ribbons, told a meeting of the Executive: 'The current position is not sustainable and councils across the country face very similar challenges.\n'Urgent measures are needed to address the situation so that we're able to balance our budget.\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\n'It is also important to identify other sources of income as a longer term option which would potentially generate additional funding.'\nCouncillor Pauline Stafford, the SNP depute group leader said: 'The issues facing this council are serious but they're not a shock. This administration has failed to understand the situation on the ground in West Lothian or to meet these challenges.'\nLinlithgow Lib Dem Sally Pattle said: 'I know we're not alone, but it does increasingly feel that we are in a desperate situation, particularly with regard to social care. I really hope that Holyrood and Westminster are taking note of this perilous situation.'\nCouncillor Ann McMIllian, Labour said she was surprised at the SNP 's 'derogatory' comments, given the Scottish Government's 'last minute' announcement of the council tax freeze last year.\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nLabour veteran Councillor Tom Conn added: 'Our financial position is not of our making.

The Hindus have been standing up for themselves despite a rabid campaign against them by the radical Islamists.\nLeading the tirade against the Hindus is the Jamaat-e-Islami backed Hefazat-e-Islam. In the most recent action, it has called for a ban on ISKCON. They are chanting slogans and painting graffiti that reads, ' catch one ISKCON and then slaughter.'\nThe Hefazat-e-Islam is based on the qawmi madrasas in Bangladesh and is seen as a far-right Islamic advocacy group.\nThe ISKCON or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is a Gaudiya Vaishnava Hindu religious organisation, which has its presence in many countries including Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, there are four ISKCONs-Chittagong, Naokhali, Mymensingh and Dhaka.\nWhile there have been no complaints about the functioning of ISKCONs in Bangladesh, the the Hefazat-e-Islam has decided to attack it as it is an important symbol of Hinduism.\nThis outfit which is not banned in Bangladesh was formed in the year 2010 to protest against Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. It said that it was opposing the Awami League's Nari Unnayan Niti or the women's development policy which proposed to confer equal rights on the inheritance law for women. It said that this policy goes against the Sharia Law.\nThe outfit however came into prominence in the year 2013 when it listed several demands, which included restrictions of free mixing of women and men and also the introduction of a blasphemy law in Bangladesh. In a nutshell, the Hefazat-e-Islam wanted to Taliabinise Bangladesh.\nSheikh Hasina had to in 2013 use force to quell the Shapla Square protest by the outfit. However in the later years, there was a compromise between the outfit and the government. Since then the relations have been blow hot blow cold. However relations strained and never improved after the Hefazat-e-Islam began criticising Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, the founding father of Bangladesh. They also protested violently when Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the 50th Independence Day celebrations of Bangladesh. This resulted in the death of 13 people.\nThe group initially only indulged in minor protests under the leadership of Ahmad Shafi, its founder. However following his death in 2020, the outfit was taken over by Junaid Babunagari and under him it became extremely hardline. Junaid Babunagari however died in 2021, but the outfit continues to follow his violent style of Isla.\nWhile it has stepped up its attacks against the Hindus today in the absence of Sheikh Hasina, it has indulged in similar acts in the past as well. During PM Modi's visit, the outfit undertook acts of violence that involved attacking a train which had several Hindus. It also indulged in violent Temple attacks.\nBatting for an Islamic State\nThe Hefazat-e-Islam has always been batting for an Islamic State in Bangladesh. Its vice president, Muhyiddin Rabbani had once said that Islam was the basis on which Pakistan was created. The Muslims are in majority in Bangladesh and this country should adhere to Islam.\nHe also said that if the Islamic law is implemented everyone will have rights in the form of justice. He adde that they would base their decisions about music on what is permissible in Islam. We do not like art of music and we shall oppose it.\nIn a nut shell what this outfit wants is that Bangladesh should be governed under the Sharia law.\nThe fall of the Sheikh Hasina government has come as a boon for outfits such as these. The Hefazat-e-Islam has been in the forefront when it comes to violence against the Hindus. The targeting Hindu Temples is one way of conveying the message that there is no place for Hindus in this country.\nThe latest in their playbook are the ISKCONs, which are very significant for the Hindus. Looking at the manner in which they issued the latest threat, it is clear that they want the ISKCONs out of the country.\nIt may not last long\nThe Deepawali message by President elect, Donald Trump came as a relief for the minorities in Bangladesh. He said that he was hurt by the persecution and demanded that it stop at once. The President elect also said that this would have never happened under his watch.\nMany Bangladesh watchers feel that Trump would put pressure on Bangladesh to stop the violence and conduct a free and fair election. To make matters worse for Bangladesh, its caretaker Muhammad Yunus does not share a rapport with Donald Trump. It would be very hard for him to navigate relations with the Trump administration. It may be recalled that in 2016 after Donald Trump had won the election, the first time, Yunus had said at a lecture in Paris that the win has hit them so hard that in the morning he could hardly talk. I lost all my strength, he said.\nMoreover Yunus is seen as a stooge of the Clintons and Obamas and this will not bode well with Trump. His stance in the past on Donald Trump and the fact that he is sleeping over the persecution of minorities, will make it extremely complex for Dhaka to deal with the new dispensation in the United States.",

        "summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that wherever a Congress government is formed, that state becomes the ATM (Automated Teller Machine) of the party's shashi parivar'.\nWe won't let Maharashtra become the ATM of Congress, Modi said, addressing a campaign rally in Akola for the November 20 state assembly elections. I challenge the shahi parivar of Congress to prove if they ever visited Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's panchteerth, Modi said. Modi has coined the term panchteerth to denote Amedbkar birthplace in Mhow, the place in London where he stayed while studying in the UK, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur where he embraced Buddhism, his Mahaparinirvan Sthal' in Delhi, and Chaitya Bhoomi' in Mumbai. People of Haryana foiled the conspiracy of Congress by following the Ek hai to safe hai' (we are safe if we are united) mantra, Modi said. The Congress knows that it will be strengthened only if the country is weakened. The policy of that party is to pit one caste against the other, he said. Modi said the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra means corruption and scams of thousands of crores of rupees. In my first two terms as the PM, I have given four crore pucca houses to the poor, Modi said. I have come to seek your blessings for the BJP-led Mahayuti (grand alliance) in the Maharashtra assembly elections, he said. On this day in 2019, the Supreme Court of the country gave its verdict on Ram Temple. This date of November 9 will also be remembered because after the decision of the Supreme Court, people of every religion showed great sensitivity, Modi said. This feeling of nation first is the biggest strength of India, he said. In the 10 years from 2014 to 2024, Maharashtra has continuously blessed the BJP wholeheartedly. There is a reason behind Maharashtra's trust in BJP. The reason for this is the patriotism, political understanding and vision of the people of Maharashtra, Modi said.",

        "summary": "By Steve Contorno, CNN\nWest Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) — Dozens of people beamed alongside Donald Trump early Wednesday morning as he was elected America's next president – including three generations of family, longtime friends, key advisers, his running mate, close political allies and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White – but the architect of his remarkable political comeback was nearly invisible amid the celebratory throng.\nThat's often how Susie Wiles prefers it.\nWiles, the understated yet formidable force behind Trump's third presidential bid, has operated in a sphere of discretion, wielding influence without the spotlight. Now, as the president-elect pivots toward his return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Wiles finds herself in an unprecedented position: On Thursday, Trump named her his incoming White House chief of staff, a role that cements her as his most trusted adviser and makes her the first woman to ever hold the title.\n'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,' Trump said in a statement. 'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again.'\nFor Wiles, 67, the new title is as improbable and as it is historic. A strategist known more for quiet calculations than public-facing gestures, at first glance she appears a mismatch for Trump and his colossal orbit of fame seekers, celebrities, firebrands and megalomaniacs. A grandmother and dog lover, she likes to bake and bird-watch.\nIn public, she hides behind a pair of polarized aviators. When people talk to her, the person they often see back is themselves.\n'Susie likes to stay sort of in the back,' Trump said Wednesday as he called on her to address his West Palm Beach victory party. She declined and passed off the mic to co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita.\nYet, for many of Trump's closest allies, it is precisely Wiles' unassuming style that has assured her longevity. Since Trump's turbulent departure from Washington, Wiles has deftly steered his political apparatus from Mar-a-Lago, instilling a level of discipline and order rarely associated with the former president.\nShe is competent, affable, respected and feared, a powerful combination in the former president's world. Those close to her suggest that her success with Trump lies in a balanced approach: She refrains from trying to restrain him but knows when to push back.\nTrump, in turn, has given her a fitting moniker: 'The Ice Maiden.'\n'The people around him, whether they like Susie or not, all agree that she doesn't stir up trouble,' Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who is close to both Trump and Wiles, told CNN in 2022. 'Brilliant, tough, strategic'\nWhat Wiles' rise signals about Trump's governing approach remains uncertain.\nTrump's third White House bid has leaned heavily on dark themes, violent imagery and promises of retribution, creating rifts within his own ranks over whether to pursue swift payback or temper the tone of his campaign.\nBy selecting Wiles — known to have cordial relationships with many Democrats and for her cooperative stance toward the press that contrasts sharply with Trump's 'enemy of the people' rhetoric — has eased some worries from the left about the president-elect's early intentions.\n'She is brilliant, tough, strategic,' Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat, wrote Thursday on X. 'She will serve the country well.'\nWhile hardly a Washington fixture, Wiles brings an understanding of government's inner workings from years spent as a DC lobbyist. As of Thursday evening, Wiles was still listed as the co-chair of the Florida and Washington, DC, offices of Mercury, a national lobbying firm. Neither Wiles nor Trump's transition team immediately responded when asked if Wiles would soon step away from her position at Mercury.\nAt Mercury, Wiles represented a subsidiary of the tobacco company Swisher International as recently as 2023, according to a database maintained by Open Secrets, a government watchdog nonprofit.\nShe previously worked for Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Trump's fundraising apparatus, where her clients included the carmaker General Motors and defense contractor Total Military Management, as well as a fossil fuel-funded energy advocacy group and the Children's Hospital Association. The gatekeeper\nWiles is credited with running what many viewed as Trump's most disciplined and strategic campaign – one that managed to keep many of the fringe voices in his orbit at a distance. Throughout much of the campaign, she held a crucial yet thankless role: Overseeing the flight manifest for Trump's private plane, a position that often required her to act as the gatekeeper when the former president was reluctant to turn people away himself.\nHer ability to navigate Trump's circle is best illustrated in the breadth of support she received from Republicans across the party's spectrum. Charlie Kirk, the leader of a right-wing young voting group, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy both praised Wiles as a good fit for the job.\n'Susie Wiles ran Trump's best campaign of the three, and it wasn't particularly close,' Kirk wrote on X. 'She's disciplined, she's smart, and she doesn't seek the limelight. She would make an incredible Chief of Staff. The president, and America, would be well served with Susie in that key role.'\nBefore agreeing to take on the role, though, Wiles sought assurances from Trump that she would have more authority than her predecessors in controlling access to the Oval Office, according to a source close to both individuals.\nDuring Trump's first term, chiefs of staff faced constant challenges as informal advisers, family members and other outside influences jockeyed for face time with the president. Trump's tendency to be swayed by the last person he spoke to – a well-known dynamic within his inner circle – made it particularly challenging for his top aides to maintain order in the West Wing.\n'The clown car can't come into the White House at will,' the source said. 'And he agrees with her.'\nStill, history suggests the clock is already ticking on her time in the role. Trump cycled through four chiefs of staff during his first term in office and the longest-serving, John Kelly, lasted just 17 months. The first person to hold the job, Reince Priebus, once said of the stories about chaos that consumed Trump's early administration: 'Take everything you've heard and multiply it by 50.'\nNor has the position led to a graceful exit. Kelly, disillusioned by the end of his tenure, left after repeated clashes with Trump and in recent weeks gave a series of interviews describing his former boss as a fascist. Mick Mulvaney, who succeeded Kelly, declined to endorse Trump in his most recent campaign.\nTrump's final chief, Mark Meadows, was forced to testify to a federal grand jury during a special counsel probe into the former president's handling of classified documents, as well as in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A House panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol voted to hold Meadows in contempt for refusing to meet with them, though the Department of Justice declined to charge him. A Florida oracle\nWiles, a veteran Florida political operative and lobbyist, has been a stalwart in Trump's political operation since his first campaign for president when she helped steer his campaign in the Sunshine State. Even then, it was an unlikely pairing.\nThe daughter of late NFL sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles first entered politics as an assistant to US Rep. Jack Kemp, an ex-teammate of her father's on the New York Giants. Kemp was deeply conservative but often described as a 'happy warrior' incapable of attacking his political opponents.\nIt was an attribute that would define many of the men for whom she worked over four decades in politics. She worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and then in his White House. She advised several mayors in Jacksonville, where she built a well-regarded consulting shop. After successfully steering an unknown businessman named Rick Scott into the Florida governor's mansion in 2010, she helmed the short-lived 2012 presidential campaign of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, whose high-road approach to politics was antithetical to Trump. When Huntsman dropped out, Wiles switched to the presidential campaign of another Mormon, Mitt Romney.\nWiles first met Trump in 2015 at his Manhattan tower in a meeting arranged by her then-boss, lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard. When she joined his presidential campaign, it sent shockwaves through the Florida political class, which had mostly aligned with the state's native sons Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio in the GOP presidential primaries.\nTrump's mercurial demeanor did not always gel with Wiles' professional style. In the final weeks of the 2016 race, Trump unloaded on Wiles in a late-night meeting during which he blamed her for polls that showed he would lose Florida, CNN previously reported. She considered quitting and he toyed with cutting her lose just 10 days before the election.\n'In her words, it was a way she had never been spoken to in her life,' a source with knowledge of the interaction told CNN in 2022.\nTrump, though, brushed past the incident and when he won Florida it earned Wiles a reputation as a Sunshine State oracle. Two years later, Trump sent Wiles to rescue the flailing campaign of his handpicked candidate for Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and she successfully steered him to a narrow win.\nBut DeSantis ultimately grew distrustful of Wiles, and privately accused her and her allies in his office of giving favoritism to her lobbying clients. In late 2019, DeSantis pushed her out of his political operation and then urged Trump to do the same. Trump sided with DeSantis and removed Wiles from his reelection team.\nWiles would get her revenge on DeSantis during the Republican presidential primary this year. The day DeSantis ended his White House bid, Wiles, who maintains a limited social media presence, posted: 'Bye bye.'\nAs Trump grew increasingly dissatisfied with his standing in Florida polls, he brought Wiles back. He then gave her nearly unfettered leeway to operate his Florida campaign as she saw fit. Over the closing months of the race, she and political strategist James Blair oversaw an innovative operation that sought to find new Trump supporters in communities not traditionally receptive to Republicans or electoral politics.\nWiles and Blair brought their approach to Trump's 2024 and extrapolated the strategy throughout battleground states, leading Trump to an Electoral College landslide. It is likely that Trump will also become the first Republican in two decades to secure the popular vote.\nThroughout the race, Wiles was a constant presence by Trump's side, traveling with him on nearly every campaign stop. Still, she remained out of the limelight – until the last week of the race. After businessman Mark Cuban told 'The View' that Trump avoids 'strong, intelligent women,' Republicans pushed back by holding up Wiles.\nThe touting continued on Thursday. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio posted on social media: 'President Trump has chosen a strong, intelligent woman to serve as White House Chief of Staff.'\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "summary": "Dozens of people beamed alongside Donald Trump early Wednesday morning as he was elected America's next president – including three generations of family, longtime friends, key advisers, his running mate, close political allies and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White – but the architect of his remarkable political comeback was nearly invisible amid the celebratory throng.\nThat's often how Susie Wiles prefers it.\nWiles, the understated yet formidable force behind Trump's third presidential bid, has operated in a sphere of discretion, wielding influence without the spotlight. Now, as the president-elect pivots toward his return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Wiles finds herself in an unprecedented position: On Thursday, Trump named her his incoming White House chief of staff, a role that cements her as his most trusted adviser and makes her the first woman to ever hold the title.\n'Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,' Trump said in a statement. 'Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again.'\nFor Wiles, 67, the new title is as improbable and as it is historic. A strategist known more for quiet calculations than public-facing gestures, at first glance she appears a mismatch for Trump and his colossal orbit of fame seekers, celebrities, firebrands and megalomaniacs. A grandmother and dog lover, she likes to bake and bird-watch.\nIn public, she hides behind a pair of polarized aviators. When people talk to her, the person they often see back is themselves.\n'Susie likes to stay sort of in the back,' Trump said Wednesday as he called on her to address his West Palm Beach victory party. She declined and passed off the mic to co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita.\nYet, for many of Trump's closest allies, it is precisely Wiles' unassuming style that has assured her longevity. Since Trump's turbulent departure from Washington, Wiles has deftly steered his political apparatus from Mar-a-Lago, instilling a level of discipline and order rarely associated with the former president.\nShe is competent, affable, respected and feared, a powerful combination in the former president's world. Those close to her suggest that her success with Trump lies in a balanced approach: She refrains from trying to restrain him but knows when to push back.\nTrump, in turn, has given her a fitting moniker: 'The Ice Maiden.'\n'The people around him, whether they like Susie or not, all agree that she doesn't stir up trouble,' Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who is close to both Trump and Wiles, told CNN in 2022.\nWhat Wiles' rise signals about Trump's governing approach remains uncertain.\nTrump's third White House bid has leaned heavily on dark themes, violent imagery and promises of retribution, creating rifts within his own ranks over whether to pursue swift payback or temper the tone of his campaign.\nBy selecting Wiles — known to have cordial relationships with many Democrats and for her cooperative stance toward the press that contrasts sharply with Trump's 'enemy of the people' rhetoric — has eased some worries from the left about the president-elect's early intentions.\n'She is brilliant, tough, strategic,' Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat, wrote Thursday on X. 'She will serve the country well.'\nWhile hardly a Washington fixture, Wiles brings an understanding of government's inner workings from years spent as a DC lobbyist. As of Thursday evening, Wiles was still listed as the co-chair of the Florida and Washington, DC, offices of Mercury, a national lobbying firm. Neither Wiles nor Trump's transition team immediately responded when asked if Wiles would soon step away from her position at Mercury.\nAt Mercury, Wiles represented a subsidiary of the tobacco company Swisher International as recently as 2023, according to a database maintained by Open Secrets, a government watchdog nonprofit.\nShe previously worked for Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Trump's fundraising apparatus, where her clients included the carmaker General Motors and defense contractor Total Military Management, as well as a fossil fuel-funded energy advocacy group and the Children's Hospital Association.\nWiles is credited with running what many viewed as Trump's most disciplined and strategic campaign – one that managed to keep many of the fringe voices in his orbit at a distance. Throughout much of the campaign, she held a crucial yet thankless role: Overseeing the flight manifest for Trump's private plane, a position that often required her to act as the gatekeeper when the former president was reluctant to turn people away himself.\nHer ability to navigate Trump's circle is best illustrated in the breadth of support she received from Republicans across the party's spectrum. Charlie Kirk, the leader of a right-wing young voting group, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy both praised Wiles as a good fit for the job.\n'Susie Wiles ran Trump's best campaign of the three, and it wasn't particularly close,' Kirk wrote on X. 'She's disciplined, she's smart, and she doesn't seek the limelight. She would make an incredible Chief of Staff. The president, and America, would be well served with Susie in that key role.'\nBefore agreeing to take on the role, though, Wiles sought assurances from Trump that she would have more authority than her predecessors in controlling access to the Oval Office, according to a source close to both individuals.\nDuring Trump's first term, chiefs of staff faced constant challenges as informal advisers, family members and other outside influences jockeyed for face time with the president. Trump's tendency to be swayed by the last person he spoke to – a well-known dynamic within his inner circle – made it particularly challenging for his top aides to maintain order in the West Wing.\n'The clown car can't come into the White House at will,' the source said. 'And he agrees with her.'\nStill, history suggests the clock is already ticking on her time in the role. Trump cycled through four chiefs of staff during his first term in office and the longest-serving, John Kelly, lasted just 17 months. The first person to hold the job, Reince Priebus, once said of the stories about chaos that consumed Trump's early administration: 'Take everything you've heard and multiply it by 50.'\nNor has the position led to a graceful exit. Kelly, disillusioned by the end of his tenure, left after repeated clashes with Trump and in recent weeks gave a series of interviews describing his former boss as a fascist. Mick Mulvaney, who succeeded Kelly, declined to endorse Trump in his most recent campaign.\nTrump's final chief, Mark Meadows, was forced to testify to a federal grand jury during a special counsel probe into the former president's handling of classified documents, as well as in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A House panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol voted to hold Meadows in contempt for refusing to meet with them, though the Department of Justice declined to charge him.\nWiles, a veteran Florida political operative and lobbyist, has been a stalwart in Trump's political operation since his first campaign for president when she helped steer his campaign in the Sunshine State. Even then, it was an unlikely pairing.\nThe daughter of late NFL sportscaster Pat Summerall, Wiles first entered politics as an assistant to US Rep. Jack Kemp, an ex-teammate of her father's on the New York Giants. Kemp was deeply conservative but often described as a 'happy warrior' incapable of attacking his political opponents.\nIt was an attribute that would define many of the men for whom she worked over four decades in politics. She worked on Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and then in his White House. She advised several mayors in Jacksonville, where she built a well-regarded consulting shop. After successfully steering an unknown businessman named Rick Scott into the Florida governor's mansion in 2010, she helmed the short-lived 2012 presidential campaign of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, whose high-road approach to politics was antithetical to Trump. When Huntsman dropped out, Wiles switched to the presidential campaign of another Mormon, Mitt Romney.\nWiles first met Trump in 2015 at his Manhattan tower in a meeting arranged by her then-boss, lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard. When she joined his presidential campaign, it sent shockwaves through the Florida political class, which had mostly aligned with the state's native sons Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio in the GOP presidential primaries.\nTrump's mercurial demeanor did not always gel with Wiles' professional style. In the final weeks of the 2016 race, Trump unloaded on Wiles in a late-night meeting during which he blamed her for polls that showed he would lose Florida, CNN previously reported. She considered quitting and he toyed with cutting her lose just 10 days before the election.\n'In her words, it was a way she had never been spoken to in her life,' a source with knowledge of the interaction told CNN in 2022.\nTrump, though, brushed past the incident and when he won Florida it earned Wiles a reputation as a Sunshine State oracle. Two years later, Trump sent Wiles to rescue the flailing campaign of his handpicked candidate for Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and she successfully steered him to a narrow win.\nBut DeSantis ultimately grew distrustful of Wiles, and privately accused her and her allies in his office of giving favoritism to her lobbying clients. In late 2019, DeSantis pushed her out of his political operation and then urged Trump to do the same. Trump sided with DeSantis and removed Wiles from his reelection team.\nWiles would get her revenge on DeSantis during the Republican presidential primary this year. The day DeSantis ended his White House bid, Wiles, who maintains a limited social media presence, posted: 'Bye bye.'\nAs Trump grew increasingly dissatisfied with his standing in Florida polls, he brought Wiles back. He then gave her nearly unfettered leeway to operate his Florida campaign as she saw fit. Over the closing months of the race, she and political strategist James Blair oversaw an innovative operation that sought to find new Trump supporters in communities not traditionally receptive to Republicans or electoral politics.\nWiles and Blair brought their approach to Trump's 2024 and extrapolated the strategy throughout battleground states, leading Trump to an Electoral College landslide. It is likely that Trump will also become the first Republican in two decades to secure the popular vote.\nThroughout the race, Wiles was a constant presence by Trump's side, traveling with him on nearly every campaign stop. Still, she remained out of the limelight – until the last week of the race. After businessman Mark Cuban told 'The View' that Trump avoids 'strong, intelligent women,' Republicans pushed back by holding up Wiles.\nThe touting continued on Thursday. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio posted on social media: 'President Trump has chosen a strong, intelligent woman to serve as White House Chief of Staff.'",

Pranjal is the son of senior Congress leader and former minister Paban Singh Ghatowar.\nHe went to Samaguri to campaign for Congress nominee Tanzil Hussain; however, the workers demonstrated against Ghatowar and raised slogans against him. They insisted that Ghatowar should leave the place immediately. The incident unfolded on Friday, late at night in Samaguri.\nAccording to party sources, the supporters were irked with Pranjal Ghatowar due to the news that broke out a few days ago that he might join BJP along with his father Paban Singh Ghatowar.\nThe contest in Samaguri between BJP and Congress has become very interesting. A total of five Assembly seats will be contested for in the by-elections on November 13 and except Samaguri, BJP and its allies have been holding rest of the four seats.\nAccording to pollsters, due to the dominance of Muslim voters in the Samaguri seat, Congress has an edge over the BJP here. BJP fielded candidates for three seats—Dholai, Samaguri and Behali.\nDiplu Ranjan Sarma has been given ticket in Samaguri while Diganta Ghatowar and Nihar Ranjan Das will fight for BJP in Behali and Dholai Assembly segments respectively. BJP's two allies—Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People's Party Liberal (UPPL) are contesting polls in Bongaigaon and Sidli Assembly constituencies.\nCM Sarma recently launched a scathing attack on Congress MP and former minister Rakibul Hussain alleging that the latter gave government jobs through backdoors during his tenure as minister in the state.\nHe said, 'Rakibul Hussain himself acknowledged that he had been given government jobs while he was the minister in Assam during the Congress regime. However, a minister is not capable of giving jobs to anyone and hence, Hussain must be interrogated by the police on his claim.'\nThe Chief Minister further said that once the elections are over, the police will act against the Congress MP. 'I have asked the police to interrogate Rakibul Hussin after the by-elections,' he stated.\nIANS",

        "excerpt": "Politicians are going back on their words – and, in one case, deleting them – as they congratulate the president-elect. But who said what?",
        "summary": "Not since a 'hot mic' caught David Cameron\nIn the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the US election this week, a host of Left-wingers and other leaders who castigated him in the past – probably assuming he was more likely to go to jail than return to the White House – have been rushing out statements, congratulating the Republican on his sensational win and saying how much they cannot wait to work with him.\nEmbarrassing? Yes. But also hilarious. Here, we present the most excruciating about-turns...\nDavid Lammy\nForeign Secretary\nDiplomacy was not at the forefront of David Lammy's mind in a\nTime\nmagazine article in 2018 as he vowed to protest against Donald Trump's visit to the UK, branding the president a '\nNow, however, as the UK's chief diplomat, he has been forced to take a rather more conciliatory tone. On Wednesday, he tweeted his 'congratulations' to Trump on his victory, who he would now 'look forward to working with'.\nIn an interview with the BBC the following day, he went a step further, describing Trump as a 'funny' and 'very gracious host' when they dined together in New York recently, adding they had found 'common ground'.\nEmily Thornberry\nChair of the Foreign Affairs Committee\nRowing back on rather tactless comments made while in charge of the diplomatic brief appears to be a Labour trait of sorts. In 2019, ahead of Trump's state visit to the UK, the then shadow foreign secretary\nIt certainly appears easier to say so in opposition than when in power. While bashing the Tory government at the time for 'fawning all over him', her tone has somewhat softened as Trump has looked increasingly likely to return to office. Though refusing to back down on her comments, she has since suggested whoever won would 'be our friend' and, after his re-election, admitted it would 'not be in Britain's interests to alienate the president-elect of the USA'.\nKevin Rudd\nAustralia's ambassador to the United States\nWith Trump's ambitions to return to the White House well-known, it was perhaps unwise of Australia to install Kevin Rudd as its ambassador to the US just a year before the 2024 election. The former Australian prime minister, who served between 2007 and 2010, had, on at least three occasions during Trump's first term, openly ridiculed him during speeches, branding him a 'political liability' and 'not a leading intellectual force'.\nEarlier this year, Trump hit back at 'nasty' Rudd and claimed he 'won't be there long'. Aware of the sudden precariousness of his job this week, Rudd it seems has rather belatedly changed tack. On Thursday, he said 'out of respect'\nEmmanuel Macron\nPresident of France\nAn eager Emmanuel Macron was\nIn 2018, Macron rebuked Trump's 'nationalism' and protectionist trade policies, while Trump hit back at Macron's low approval rating and continued poking fun at him during his re-election campaign.\nDespite their war of words, Macron was among the first to swallow his pride and jump on the phone to Trump this week. With the president-elect making no secret of his plan to impose high tariffs on imports from both enemies and allies, Macron appears to be back on the charm offensive, with a French official describing the conversation as 'warm' and a 'very good exchange'.\nVolodymyr Zelensky\nPresident of Ukraine\nHistorically, there is little love lost between Ukraine's president and the president-elect, and throughout his campaign, Trump made clear his criticism of continued US funding for Ukraine's defence against Russia, calling Zelensky the 'greatest salesman on Earth' and highlighting his 'very good relationship' with\nZelensky further angered Republicans over what was seen as a highly partisan visit to an arms factory in September alongside top Democrats in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, a key swing state. Yet, likely aware of the existential threat Trump's win now poses to his country, he has quickly sought to shore up the fractious relationship.\n'We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation,' Zelensky wrote on social media this week.\nDonald Tusk\nPrime minister of Poland\nWhen\nThe following year, he branded Trump's speech endorsing nationalism and patriotism as 'false and dangerous', and in 2020 mocked Trump over his attempts to downplay the dangers of Covid.\nSince taking office in late 2023, the Polish prime minister has continued taking swipes at his bête noire. Yet, given the result, it seems to have backfired somewhat – and he is now facing calls from opposition politicians to resign to preserve good ties between Warsaw and Washington. Perhaps in a bid to placate his public, Tusk sought to publicly congratulate Trump this week, tweeting he would 'look forward to our cooperation for the good of the American and Polish nations'.\nUrsula von der Leyen\nPresident of the European Commission\nNow, as president of the European Commission, she will hope her comments don't come back to bite her. The bloc is facing a potential trade war with the US if Trump introduces his expected import tariffs. Perhaps in a bid to keep him sweet, von der Leyen has been quick to congratulate Trump on his 'clear victory' this week. 'I'm looking forward to working with him again to strengthen the transatlantic bond,' she told reporters on Thursday.\nJohn Swinney\nFirst Minister of Scotland\nAs Scottish leader, it's perhaps a little dangerous to endorse a candidate in a two-horse race so strongly across the pond – particularly when the other has such a stake in your country. Yet in the week running up to the US election,\nAlthough the Scottish government has no powers over foreign affairs, its relationships with other countries are key for investment. In a desperate attempt to build bridges, Swinney this week quickly congratulated Trump on his victory, highlighting the president-elect's Scottish descent.\n'I wish you every success in your new role,' he grovelled, adding that Scotland 'greatly appreciates' its strong ties with the US that he hoped would 'continue to flourish during your presidency'.",

        "summary": "Congress Accused of Trying to Undermine Eknath Shinde and Create Rift in Mahayuti Alliance 2\nThe Congress party is intensifying its efforts to demoralize Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and create divisions within the ruling Mahayuti alliance, according to political leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena. Congress President Nana Patole has alleged that the BJP is trying to keep Shinde under control, claiming that while the BJP presents Shinde as the Chief Minister, it is actually Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis who holds the real power.\nPatole pointed out that although BJP posters feature the logos of all three parties in the alliance, only Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Fadnavis are prominently displayed, with Shinde's image barely visible. This, Patole argued, reflects the true dynamics within the alliance.\nThe latest controversy centers around the BJP's election posters for the upcoming Assembly elections, where Shinde's photo appears in a small, passport-sized format despite the party's claims that it is contesting under his leadership. The omission of Deputy CM Ajit Pawar's photo from earlier posters had also sparked public debate, and now the minimization of Shinde's image has raised new questions about the BJP's internal power structure.\nA senior BJP leader, speaking to Afternoon Voice , dismissed the Congress's criticisms, stating, 'This is exactly what Congress has been doing all along—trying to sow division and create rifts, both within the nation and political parties. These comments will have no impact on our alliance.'\nShiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam also responded to Congress's allegations, asserting, 'We are fighting this election under the leadership of Eknath Shinde. All decisions, from seat sharing to strategy, have been made under his guidance. Congress has a habit of creating controversy, but it doesn't affect us.'\nAs the election approaches, tensions within the Mahayuti alliance and the Congress's attempts to exploit them remain a point of contention in the state's political discourse.",

Climate change not only destroyed things, but also erased identity and culture, she said.\n\"When we're talking about climate change, it's very important of course to talk about how people's lives are being impacted in terms of property, but it's so important to talk about culture as well.\"\nSylvie, also 16, said there was a strong focus on ensuring people were at the heart of the discussion at the COP Simulation in September.\n\"I think that it's really important for Aotearoa to make sure that, as an island nation, we are always finding ways to improve our responses in mitigating and adapting to climate change to help our future generation.\"\nCOP Simulation 2024.\nPhoto:\nSupplied\nSave the Children New Zealand advocacy, strategy and research director Jacqui Southey said children and young people were demanding a safer, healthier and more sustainable world, and the opportunity to be included in climate protection and decision-making.\n\"Children and youth bring personal experiences, new ideas and deep commitment to improve our world. It is well past time they were accorded the opportunity to do so,\" she said.\nThe Youth Climate Statement would form part of the global statement for Save the Children to be presented at COP29.\n\"Children's experiences, insights and advice matter and we need to ensure a focus on children's rights in climate negotiations, policies and financing at all levels.\n\"It was children who pushed the climate emergency up the political agenda and, as adults, we must step up and support children to implement their ideas for a better future.\"\nCOP Simulation 2024.\nPhoto:\nSupplied\nThe Youth Climate Statement focused on three key areas: water, sanitation and hygiene; loss and damage; and sustainable food systems.\nThe first demand was for a holistic approach that integrated global cooperation, sustainable funding mechanisms, indigenous knowledge, and local capacity building.\n\"By addressing the challenges in water, sanitation, and hygiene through equitable solutions and focusing on resilience, these recommendations contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals and fostering healthier, more sustainable communities worldwide.\"\nThe second was to build resilience and address loss and damage, particularly for Global South nations.\n\"By establishing financial mechanisms, integrating Indigenous knowledge, and investing in renewable energy, these recommendations provide a pathway towards equitable recovery.\n\"Global cooperation, education, and support will ensure that communities can adapt to the ongoing and future impacts of climate change, contributing to the achievement of the sustainable development goals.\"\nAnd the third was to build sustainable, equitable food systems that integrated indigenous knowledge, promoted food security and reduced environmental impact.\n\"By focusing on land regeneration, incentivising sustainable agriculture, and ensuring access to nutritious food, these recommendations aim to create resilient communities that can adapt to the ongoing challenges posed by climate change.\"\nPhoto:\nSupplied\nThe Youth Climate Statement was also sent to the Ministry for the Environment, Labour climate change spokesperson Megan Woods, ACT climate change spokesperson Simon Court, Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March and Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke.\nMenéndez March said it served as \"a reminder that everything is connected and that it will take all of us and taking a system lens approach to addressing the climate crisis\".\n\"It just reminds me of the importance of fighting to honour our Tiriti, and that none of the stuff outlined will be able to be done if our foundational document isn't actually respected,\" he said.\n\"It's just so important to put all these knowledges into a domestic context and recognise that we've got a fight ahead - not just globally, but here in Aotearoa too.\"\nGreen MP Ricardo Menéndez March.\nPhoto:\nPhil Smith\nWatts told RNZ younger generations would be among those most affected by climate change, and it was important for the government to hear their \"vital perspectives\".\n\"The Aotearoa Youth Statement raises important climate change issues particularly around the need for cooperation, disaster response, education and global equity.\"\nWhile Watts did not mention COP29, he said the government was committed to its climate obligations and understood the importance of New Zealand playing its part to reduce emissions and keep temperature rise in check.\nHe said the government's climate strategy, released in July, focused on making sure:\nThe final emissions reduction plan was under active consideration, and decisions would be made by the end of the year, Watts said.\nSign up for Ngā Pitopito Kōrero, a daily newsletter\ncurated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

        "summary": "New Delhi:\nAhead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Nanded and Akola in poll-bound Maharashtra, the Congress on Saturday posed questions to him on his vision for the Marathwada region including his solution for water scarcity and inadequate rail infrastructure.\n\"The non-biological PM is in Nanded and Akola today. Four questions for him - Where does the BJP stand on the issue of a caste census and raising the cap of 50% once 50 per cent cap reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBCs imposed by the Supreme Court?\" Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh posted on X.\nThe non-biological PM is in Nanded and Akola today. Four questions for him –\n1.Where does the BJP stand on the issue of a caste census and raising the cap of 50% on reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBCs imposed by the Supreme Court?\nThe Congress…\n— Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh)\nHe claimed the Congress government in neighbouring Telangana is starting its door-to-door caste survey on Saturday and will cover 1.17 crore households. \"Meanwhile, the non-biological PM will be in Vidarbha - which has played such a central role in the struggle for social justice in the country - and will likely be entirely silent on the pressing issue of a caste census and the raising of the cap of 50% on reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBCs.\nWhy is the non-biological PM so silent? What is he afraid of?\" he asked. The Congress leader also asked whether the PM will deliver on his promise to put the BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Chavan in jail. Ramesh said while campaigning in Nanded on March 30, 2014, Modi had announced he would send Ashok Chavan to jail \"within six months\" if he became PM.\nTen years later, Ashok Chavan joined the BJP and was rewarded with a Rajya Sabha seat. His daughter is now a BJP contestant from the Bhokar assembly seat, he noted. \"Will this prove to be a promise delayed but not denied - or has the BJP Washing Machine cleared Mr Chavan of any alleged wrongdoing?\" Ramesh asked.\nThe Congress leader also asked why the Indian Railways performed so poorly in the Nanded division. The Congress leader said the railway infrastructure in the Nanded division, which serves many areas in Marathwada, has been subjected to blatant neglect by the Modi government.\nAccording to data furnished by the South Central Railway (SCR) in 2021, Nanded only has 35 km of route electrification and only 83 km of track-doubling. This puts it at the bottom in terms of electrification and only marginally ahead of the bottom in track-doubling compared to other SCR divisions, Ramesh said.\nAdditionally, it is the only division in its zone that still has 130 km of colonial-era meter-gauge tracks, he claimed. \"Every election season, Mr. Modi is happy to come to Marathwada and ask for votes but the area never sees the progress and development that he speaks of. Why has crucial railway infrastructure been neglected in Nanded? Does the non-biological PM have any real vision for bringing development to the Marathwada region?\n\"What is Mr Modi's vision to address water scarcity in Marathwada,\" Ramesh also asked. In 2019, he said, the then Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis promised a 20,000 to 25,000 crore package to build a water grid from Marathwada that would supply piped drinking water to every village.\nSummer this year marked five years of this promise -- and it was one of the most water-scarce years that Marathwada has faced, the former Union minister said. He claimed that more than 600 villages and 178 hamlets in Marathwada were dependent on water tankers.\n\"Only 19% of drinking water was left in reservoirs. What has the BJP done to tackle water scarcity in Marathwada? Will the non-biological PM ever take responsibility for his and his party's failures?\" Ramesh asked. Campaigning in Maharashtra has picked up for the November 20 assembly polls in which the opposition INDIA bloc under MVA is seeking to wrest power from the ruling Mahayuti.",

According to what this newspaper learned, this Friday morning, an Air China plane made a technical scale to Gran Canaria to refuel en route to Lima. During this stop, they took the opportunity to download material related to the visit of the Chinese president, with a security system from the National Police.\nThe Chinese president will make a stopover on the round island on his return from his visit to Brazil, where he will lead a work program focused on strengthening trade and strategic relations. His arrival is expected at the start of the week..\nClose sources indicate that this stop will not only be a technical resupply stop, but that Xi Jinping will spend at least a night on the island. During his stay, he plans to visit the port of Las Palmas, where part of the Chinese fishing fleet operates, as well as the Casa de Colón. According to these sources, the president will stay at the Santa Catalina Hotel, which has been reinforced to guarantee his security. If the visit is confirmed, it is likely that the Spanish government will send a minister to the islands to accompany the Chinese president.\nReport a bug",

        "excerpt": "Singh called the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) tour a drama and a medium to divert attention from the issues",
        "summary": "Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh on Saturday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of forcefully attempting to pass Waqf (amendment) bill.\nSpeaking to ANI, Singh said, \"PM Narendra Modi is forcefully trying to pass Waqf (amendment) bill. He does not even want to hold a discussion in the JPC, leaving all parliamentary rules and traditions. This is happening for the first time - all the opposition parties boycotted the JPC tour, despite that it is being held.\"\nSingh called the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) tour a drama and a medium to divert attention from the issues.\n\"If the opposition does not go to a meeting, the quorum remains incomplete. I do not know whether the quorum is being completed or not in today's Guwahati tour. This JPC is a drama. The JPC was just a medium to divert attention from the issues. In reality, the Modi government does not want any discussion in JPC,\" Singh said.\nThe JPC meeting on the Waqf Amendment Bill began in Guwahati on Saturday. The Joint Committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, is conducting a study tour from November 9 to November 14 in five cities: Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Patna, and Lucknow to examine the bill.\nThe committee plans to present its report on the bill to the House by the end of the first week of the Winter Session of Parliament, which runs from November 25 to December 20.\nThe JPC's efforts are part of a larger national initiative to reform the Waqf Act and ensure that waqf properties are used for the greater good of the community.\nThe Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 has held 25 meetings so far since August 22. The JPC reviewed the work of six ministries and heard from 123 stakeholders, including representatives from six states, eight Waqf boards and four minority commissions.\n\"I held the first meeting on August 22. Since then, 25 meetings have been conducted. During these meetings, we examined six ministries and engaged with 37 stakeholders, including Islamic and minority organisations. Approximately 123 stakeholders have appeared before the committee. Among them were three MPs, three MLAs, MLCs, and a Minister of State from Gujarat. Additionally, representatives from six states, eight Waqf Boards, and four Minority Commissions have appeared,\" Pal explained.\nThe Waqf Act, 1995, was originally established to regulate Waqf properties, but it has long faced criticism over issues of mismanagement, corruption, and encroachments. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha this August, seeks to bring sweeping reforms, introducing digitisation, stricter audits, transparency and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties.\nThe JPC is conducting a series of meetings to gather input from government officials, legal experts, Waqf Board members, and community representatives from various states and Union Territories, aiming to achieve comprehensive reform.",

Still, Defence has struggled to fill its numbers as most branches, except the Air Force, have shrunk despite increasing recruitment focus.\nThe ADF has forecast a demand for just shy of 67,000 uniformed soldiers by 2027-28, representing a near-15 per cent increase on its current overall ranks of around just over 58,000.\nThe weekend's careers expo, which boasted gap year opportunities for school leavers, coincided with another military open day at Singleton.\nFort Scracthley volunteers, who have similarly struggled to fill numbers to keep the city's iconic military history site open, said there were few more fitting places to host the active branches of the nation's defence. One volunteer said he arrived early on Saturday morning, where visitors were already lining up at the gate for the day's events, which included a ceremonial firing the fort's guns during the afternoon.",

Meanwhile, in Jharkhand, the JMM faces a new challenge after Hemant Soren's recent arrest and Champai, a longstanding party member, joining the BJP. The Haryana election resulted in a shock loss for Congress, which was looking to galvanize on the Lok Sabha poll performance, while J&K also saw the grand old party eventually stepping away from the cabinet, with Omar Abdullah 's JKNC forming government.

[…] More guns, more bombs, more chaos and conflict will not end this war. More dialogue, more diplomacy, more agreements will open the door to peace,' Erdogan said.\nThe politician also noted that the West does not sufficiently share Turkey's belief that problems can be resolved through diplomacy.\n'We are a country that has managed to bring both sides to the same table. We have done it many times and we can do it again. This war must end now. We have focused our efforts on peace and will continue to do so. 'We hope that we will make a new start in a new era and achieve a world where all conflicts and wars will end,' Erdogan said.\nRegarding Turkey's expectations from the new US president, Erdogan said ending the Russo-Ukrainian war was one of the biggest challenges.\n'As Turkey, our expectations from our ally, the United States, are known. We face many challenges, mainly the Palestinian question and the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. It is possible to overcome them with cooperation of Turkey and the United States 'I hope that regional and global wars and crises will end with Trump's presidency,' Erdogan said.\nPhoto: AA",

It is a paradox that Jharkhand, rich in mineral resources, is one of the poorest states,\" Jharkhand Chief Minister Soren claimed in an exclusive interview with PTI.\n\"We are rich in resources coal, iron ore, bauxite, dolomite but our revenue collection is hampered by the central government's GST regime, which smashed the backbones of states like Jharkhand. It did nothing to address our financial needs,\" he alleged.\nSoren said despite writing to PM Narendra Modi repeatedly, the Rs 1.36 lakh-crore coal dues to the state were yet to be cleared.\nHe charged the BJP with acting on a \"fixed agenda of divisive politics, Hindu-Muslim polarisation, and communal hatred to grab power\", claiming that it is the misfortune of the country that healthy political competition was being wiped out.\nThey have no agenda for development, employment, or economic prosperity. The only agenda they know is division. They speak of divisive politics, foster communal hatred, and promote Hindu-Muslim polarisation, he alleged.\nSoren claimed that the BJP-led Centre could \"not digest a tribal CM completing a full five-year tenure\", accusing it of holding the elections before time to undermine his government.\nHe also accused the central dispensation of being a \"poaching master\".\n\"The BJP-led Centre is a poaching master. They are experts in poaching MLAs, MPs, and toppling governments,\" Soren alleged.\n\"Ever since we came to power, they have thrown everything at us irrelevant allegations, conspiracies, and smear campaigns. They thought they could break our party, buy our MLAs, but with the people's blessings, I came out, stronger than ever,\" he claimed.\nThe chief minister criticised the BJP for allegedly undermining the political discourse in the country.\nWhat kind of political discourse are they bringing to the table? They have reduced it to a battle of accusations and dirty tricks. They bring in outsiders to break parties and destroy the political fabric of states CMs of some states are camping here for months. Why is no one bothered about what's happening in their states? Social media weapons have been unleashed by the BJP to spread fake narratives, and massive funds are being spent on pushing propaganda, he alleged.\nTaking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Soren alleged: If PM Modi had his ways, he would have brought star campaigners from abroad to win Jharkhand elections.\nOn BJP's charges that tribals in Jharkhand were under greater threat than those in Manipur, Soren hit back, saying it was \"like the pot calling the kettle black\" and accused the saffron party of being behind the violence in the northeastern state.\n\"Manipur burns. Why aren't they focusing on Manipur? They are too busy creating divisions elsewhere. They do not even notice what's happening in their double-engine state. That state is in turmoil under their rule. What has their double-engine government achieved? Nothing but division and violence,\" Soren claimed.\nHe slammed the BJP for \"spreading the propaganda of infiltration\".\n\"They say infiltration is on the rise. If it is so, who is responsible? I want to ask the Home Minister Amit Shah? Soren said.\nTerming the BJP \"a party of traders\", he alleged that the saffron camp \"controlled\" the central agencies like the CBI and the ED which conveniently \"ignored the corruption and malpractices within its own ranks\".\n\"They accuse us of corruption, but what about the BJP's own scandals? No investigations are conducted into huge drug seizures at Gujarat's ports or scams involving corporations,\" he alleged.\nOn the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), he said Jharkhand did not need it, questioning why the BJP was keeping tribals out of its purview.\nThere is no need of UCC here We have stronger provisions to protect tribalsThey talk about issues like UCC and NRC but fail to address the real concerns of the common people,\" he remarked.\nHe added that the results of the five-year struggle would be out on November 23 when the Jharkhand election results are announced.\nElections to the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly are scheduled for November 13 and November 20.",

        "summary": "Former President Donald Trump is reflected in bulletproof glass as he finishes his speech at a campaign rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, November 3. Matt Rourke/AP .\nswitch captionMatt Rourke/AP\nWASHINGTON The Justice Department on Friday revealed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he was instructed by a government official before this week's election to plan the president-elect's assassination republican.\nInvestigators were tipped off about the Trump assassination plan by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government agent who spent time in U.S. prisons on theft charges and who authorities say maintained a network of criminal associates conscripted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots.\nShakeri told the FBI that a contact within Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guards asked him last September to put aside any other work he was doing and come up with a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to an unsealed criminal complaint in Manhattan federal court. .\nThe official was quoted by Shakeri as saying that 'We have already spent a lot of money' and that money is not an issue. Shakeri told investigators that the official told him that if he could not come up with a plan within the seven-day period, then the plot would be put on hold until after the election because the official assumed Trump would lose and that it would then be easier to kill him, the complaint states.\nShakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill prominent Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, who was the victim of several Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement.\n'I'm very shocked,' Alinejad said, speaking by telephone to The Associated Press from Berlin, where she was preparing to attend a ceremony marking the anniversary of the fall of the wall. This is the third attempt on me and it's shocking.\nIn a post on social media platform tyranny and I deserve to be safe. Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me, but I urge the U.S. government to protect America's national security.\nAttorneys for the other two defendants, identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The Iranian mission to the UN declined to comment.\nShakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the United States as a child but was later deported after spending 14 years in prison for theft, also told investigators he was charged by his contact with the Guardians of the Revolution to plan the murder of two American Jews living in New York. York and Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. Officials say he was around Rivera while incarcerated as well as an unidentified co-conspirator.\nThe criminal complaint says Shakeri disclosed some details of the alleged plots in a series of recorded telephone interviews with FBI agents while they were in Iran. The stated reason for his cooperation, he told investigators, was to try to get a reduced prison sentence for an associate behind bars in the United States.\nAccording to the complaint, although authorities determined that some of the information he provided was false, his statements about a plot to kill Trump and Iran's willingness to pay large sums of money were found to be accurate. .\nThe plot, announced by the Justice Department just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, is part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on American soil. Last summer, for example, the Justice Department indicted a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting U.S. officials.\nThere are few actors in the world that pose as serious a threat to U.S. national security as Iran, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the case showed Iran's brazen and relentless attempts to target American citizens, including Trump, other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the Tehran regime.\nIranian agents also conducted a hacking and leaking operation of emails belonging to Trump campaign associates, which officials viewed as an attempt to interfere in the presidential election and harm Trump's campaign.\nIntelligence officials have said Iran opposes Trump's reelection, seeing it as likely to increase tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Trump administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iranian leaders to vow revenge.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said the president-elect knew about the assassination plot and nothing would stop him from returning to the White House and restoring world peace.\nSources\n1/ https://Google.com/\n2/ https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department\nThe mention sources can contact us to remove/changing this article\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

I have a report from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. According to this report, the way the number of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi infiltrators is increasing in Mumbai, the Hindu population in the city will be reduced to 54 per cent. That is why we (BJP) say 'Ek hai toh safe hai.\"\n\"Mumbai Congress President says they will recognise all illegal mosques in Mumbai. Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole says they will not allow a law to be formed to curb 'love jihad' and take back all the love jihad cases. That is why voters have decided 'Ek hai toh safe hai,\" said Somaiya.\nMeanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his 'Ek hai toh safe hai' remark in the Dhule rally, questioning the need for the statement and, emphasizing that the people of Maharashtra are already \"safe\" and would prefer to be safer by ousting the BJP.\nSpeaking to ANI, Sanjay Raut said, \"Why has the need arisen for the PM to say things like these. 'Batenge toh katenge' did not work here and the people of Maharashtra threw it out. Now 'ek hain toh safe hain', who is he trying to unite and who is he trying to save? Are all the people of the state and country not yours? We are safe in Maharashtra and we want to be safer so we will throw BJP out.\"\nThis comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a jab at the opposition on Friday, likening the Maha Vikas Aghadi to a vehicle without wheels or brakes and called them out for \"misgovernance\" and \"looting\" the people of the state.\nAddressing a gathering in Dhule ahead of the November 20 Assembly elections, the Prime Minister said, \"MVA's 'gaadi' has neither wheels nor brakes and there's a fight as to who will sit on the driver's seat. Their only aim in politics is to loot people. When people like MVA form government, they cause hindrances in every government policy and development.\"\nFurther taking a hit at the Congress party, PM Modi said that the party's agenda is to create a rift between all the tribal communities of the country.\n\"Congress' agenda is to create a rift between all the tribal communities of the country. When Congress tried this conspiracy with religious groups, it led to the partition of the country. Now Congress is inciting SC, ST, and OBC categories against each other. There can be no bigger conspiracy for India. You will stay strong as long as you stay united. 'Ek hai toh safe hai,\" said PM Modi.PM Modi further said the people of Maharashtra have already seen MVA's misgovernance for two and a half years.\nThe Prime Minister lauded the development works carried out by the Mahayuti government in the state and said the momentum will continue once their government is formed again in the state.\nThe Maharashtra assembly elections are scheduled for November 20, with votes for all 288 constituencies to be counted on November 23.\nThe opposition MVA coalition, comprising Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and the Nationalist Congress Party (SCP), seeks to reclaim power in the state, challenging the Mahayuti alliance, which includes Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Ajit Pawar-led NCP.\nIn the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena secured 56, and Congress 44. In 2014, the BJP won 122 seats, Shiv Sena 63, and Congress 42.",
